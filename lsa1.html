<h1 data-number="1" id="goals"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Goals</h1>
<p>The big picture learning goals for the Mathematica Lab Skill
activities are that you would be able to successfully use Mathematica
throughout this course for presenting data, data analysis, computational
modeling, and documenting your work in a well-organized and efficient
way. By working through these lessons together, using the same program
(Mathematica), we will have a shared experience with a powerful
computational tool. In addition to the instructor, your classmates
become a valuable resource for problem solving when you are using
Mathematica, similar to working in a research lab. Also, the Mathematica
screencasts are always available on YouTube for reference when you are
completing similar tasks in the lab.</p>
<p>You will be…</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>…able to use Mathematica as a calculator.</p></li>
<li><p>…able to use Mathematica’s built in help.</p></li>
<li><p>…able to efficiently enter data into Mathematica.</p></li>
<li><p>…able to create plots of functions and data.</p></li>
<li><p>…able to create nicely formatted and well-organized Mathematica
notebooks.</p></li>
<li><p>…motivated to learn Mathematica.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 data-number="2" id="why-mathematica"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Why Mathematica?</h1>
<p>Mathematica has four essential features:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>It is commonly used in the Physics Department at CU and elsewhere
(MATLAB is also extremely common in Physics labs).</p></li>
<li><p>It has all the essential capabilities for computational modeling,
plotting, and data analysis needed for this course. Once you learn these
skills in one software package, it is much easier to learn another
package.</p></li>
<li><p>Computer modeling is a way to tackle problems which are not
analytically solvable, and for visualization of both simple and
sophisticated problems.</p></li>
<li><p>Mathematica is <em>free</em> for all faculty and students through
a university site license.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Other possible options were not as desirable for a few reasons. CU
does not have a site license for MATLAB that allows for installation on
student machines. Python is free with all the necessary functionality,
but is less commonly used than Mathematica or MATLAB.</p>

<h1 data-number="4" id="plotting-functions"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Plotting Functions</h1>
<p>You will often find it useful to plot functions. For example, in the
process of doing an experiment, you may need to visualize a theoretical
prediction. Another common example is plotting fitted curve to the data.
This screencast takes you through the basics of plotting functions using
the <code>Plot</code> function.</p>

<h1 data-number="5" id="manually-entering-data-into-mathematica"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> Manually Entering Data into
Mathematica</h1>
<p>Entering data efficiently into Mathematica will be useful anytime you
take data by hand. You may have to enter data from your lab notebook
into Mathematica, or you may enter it directly into Mathematica. Even in
the case of computerized data acquisition you will often have to record
the filename and location and other settings which are not saved in the
data file.</p>

<p><strong><em>Option 1: Entering data as a Mathematica
list</em></strong></p>
<p>Regardless of how you input the data, it is always represented as a
Mathematica list. Lists are like arrays. The following data from Table 1
has been directly entered as a list. The downside is it requires many
curly brackets, and we lose the row-column format of the original data
which may make you more prone to mistakes as you enter the data.</p>
<p><code>data = {{0.3,1.553},{0.4,1.531},{0.5,1.521},{0.6,1.516},{0.7,1.513},{0.8,1.511}}</code></p>
<p><strong><em>Option 2: Entering data as a nicely formatted
table</em></strong></p>
<p>In Mathematica you can directly enter data in the form of a table.
Keyboard shortcuts make it very easy to create additional rows and
columns. <code>&lt;ctrl+comma&gt;</code> or
<code>&lt;cmd+comma&gt;</code> creates a new column.
<code>&lt;ctrl+enter&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;cmd+enter&gt;</code>
creates a new row.</p>
<p>Watch the <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9xJHjPjF8io">Screencast on entering
data as a table and plotting it</a>.</p>
<p>There is an <a
href="http://www.wolfram.com/broadcast/video.php?sx=grid&amp;c=89&amp;v=581">optional
screencast</a> produced by Wolfram which is informative.</p>
<h1 data-number="6" id="plotting-data"><span
class="header-section-number">6</span> Plotting Data</h1>
<p>Plotting data is another skill that is essential in the lab. By the
end of this section you should be able to use the <code>ListPlot</code>
function for plotting data. When using <code>ListPlot</code> you need to
be sure the data in the correct form. The most common form data is a
list of pairs of numbers. For example,
<code>{{x1,y1},{x2,y2},…}</code>.</p>

Mathematica.</li>

<h1 data-number="7" id="getting-help-in-mathematica"><span
class="header-section-number">7</span> Getting Help in Mathematica</h1>
<p>We are not born knowing Mathematica, so how can you get help?
Mathematica’s built-in help is very complete and helpful. Google
searches will still sometimes be necessary, but the resources within
Mathematica are often the best and fastest way to solve your problems.
There are many different ways that Mathematica can provide help. The
screencast will go over six:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Searching the Documentation Center [Help-&gt;Documentation
Center]</p></li>
<li><p><code>&lt;F1&gt;</code>brings up the Documentation Center and
searches for any word the cursor is touching.</p></li>
<li><p>Executing <code>?FunctionName</code> in an input cell gives the
basic syntax within the Mathematica notebook.</p></li>
<li><p>Autocomplete: Keyboard shortcut <code>&lt;ctrl+k&gt;</code> or
[Edit-&gt;Complete Selection]</p></li>
<li><p>Autocomplete function arguments: Keyboard shortcut
<code>&lt;ctrl+shift+k&gt;</code> or [Edit-&gt;Make Template]</p></li>
<li><p>Color coding</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Watch the <a href="http://youtu.be/iS4ZIugPuWc">screencast on using
Mathematica’s built-in help.</a></p>
<p>Use Mathematica’s help to do the following tasks and answer the
following questions:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Make a contour plot of any function of <span class="math inline">\(𝑧
= 𝑓(𝑥, 𝑦)\)</span> of your choice.</li>
<li>What is Mathematica’s built in function name for inverse sine?</li>
<li>What does the <code>Table</code> function do? Use <code>Table</code>
the function and explain how your code explains the result.</li>
<li>How do you numerically evaluate a result that still has <span
class="math inline">\(\pi\)</span>’s and square roots in it?</li>
</ol>
<h1 data-number="8" id="using-mathematica-effectively-in-lab"><span
class="header-section-number">8</span> Using Mathematica Effectively in
Lab</h1>
<p>If you use Mathematica notebooks effectively in the lab, they will be
a place to have your data, plots, analysis, and results all in one
place. This section of the lab skill activity will show you how to add
organization like Titles, subtitles, sections, and subsections to your
document. It will also show you how to annotate your document with
paragraphs of text, well-formatted equations, and additional annotations
to plots.</p>
<p>Watch the screencast on <a
href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=anO_IXgZRuk">using Mathematica
effectively in the lab.</a></p>
<p>Your Mathematica notebook can be a convenient way to organize a lot
of your data, plots, ideas, graphics. Let’s apply some of the formatting
features learned in this activity to your current Mathematica notebook.
You will probably find it helpful to use the “Classroom Assistant
Palette” to complete these tasks.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Create a Title section for your document, give it a reasonable
name.</li>
<li>Create a Subtitle section and give your name.</li>
<li>Create a new Section for each problem.</li>
<li>If you can, take a picture with your cell phone and get it into your
document.</li>
<li>Create a Text Cell and enter notes about what you took a picture
of.</li>
<li>Insert a “Display Equation” and input a nicely formatted version of
one of your favorite physics equations.</li>
<li>Add a hyperlink to some interesting physics website.</li>
