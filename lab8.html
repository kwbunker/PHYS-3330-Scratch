<p>As discussed in the last lab, transistors are the basic devices
providing control of large currents with small signals. There are two
general types of transistors, bipolar and field-effect. The difference
between these two types is that for bipolar devices an <em>input
current</em> controls the large current flow through the device, while
for field-effect transistors an <em>input voltage</em> provides the
current control. In the last experiment, you used the transistor as a
voltage amplifier. In the present experiment, you explore using the FET
type transistors as a current controller to create an electromagnet.</p>

<p>The input to a FET is called the gate (see Figure <a
href="#fig:mosfetpo">2</a>), analogous to the base of a bipolar
transistor. But unlike the situation with bipolar transistors, almost no
current flows into the gate, and FETs are nearly ideal voltage
amplifiers with very high input impedance. In junction FETs (JFETs) the
gate is connected to the rest of the device through a reverse-biased pn
junction, while in metal-oxide-semiconductor FETs (MOSFETs) the gate is
connected via a thin insulating oxide layer. Bipolar transistors come in
two polarities called npn and pnp, and similarly FETs come in two
polarities called n-channel and p-channel.</p>
<p>In integrated circuit form, small MOSFETs are ubiquitous in digital
electronics, used in everything from simple logic circuits to the
2.5-billion transistor Intel 10-core Xeon processor chip. Small MOSFETs
are also used in some op-amps, particularly when very low supply current
is needed, as in portable battery-powered circuits. Small discrete
(single) MOSFETs are not normally used because they are extremely
fragile. Large discrete MOSFETs are used in all sorts of high power
applications, including commercial radio transmitters.</p>
<p>JFETs add very little intrinsic noise to a circuit, and a JFET input
op-amp is often the first choice for low-noise amplification. Discrete
JFETs are commonly seen in scientific instruments. Consider using a JFET
when low-noise is critical. While we will not be exploring this feature
in the current lab, you might consider this for a future project.</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="mosfet-current-voltage-relations"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> MOSFET Current-Voltage
Relations</h1>
<p>MOSFETs can operate in three distinct regions. The first region is
where the gate-to-source voltage, <span
class="math inline">\(V_{GS}\)</span>, is less than the threshold
voltage, <span class="math inline">\(V_{th}\)</span>. In this region,
the MOSFET is turned off and no current can flow. The second region is
when <span class="math inline">\(V_{GS} &gt; V_{th}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(V_{DS} &lt; (V_{GS} ~–~ V_{th})\)</span>. In this
linear region, the transistor is turned on, and a channel has been
created that allows current to flow between the drain and the source. In
this region, the MOSFET operates like a resistor, controlled by the gate
voltage relative to both the source and drain voltages. In the third
region, <span class="math inline">\(V_{GS} &gt; V_{th}\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(V_{DS} \ge (V_{GS} - V_{th})\)</span>. This
is called the saturation region. Here the current is controlled by the
gate voltage and is nearly independent of <span
class="math inline">\(V_{DS}\)</span>. We will work in the saturation
region for this lab. The linear and saturation regions are separated by
the dotted line in Figure <span class="citation"
data-cites="figmosfetchar">@figmosfetchar</span>. In the saturation
region, the dependence of current on <span
class="math inline">\(V_{GS}\)</span> is modeled by <span
class="math inline">\(I_D = k(V_{GS} ~–~V_{th})^2\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(k\)</span> is a constant that depends on the
device.</p>

yourself before handling the device. Also, never apply power to a MOSFET
before the gate is properly terminated. If the gate is left open, it
will turn on when the power supply is connected to the circuit.</li>

have a heat-sink attached to your MOSFET. Also, do not touch the FET
until you are sure it has cooled off after use.</li>
