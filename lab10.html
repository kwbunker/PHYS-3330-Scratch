<p>In this lab, we will get a sense of the capabilities of Arduino
microcontrollers. Microcontrollers bridge the gap between digital
electronics and full-fledged computers. They can be versatile tools as
well as lots of fun!</p>
<h1 data-number="2" id="definitions"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Definitions</h1>
<p><strong>FPGA</strong> – “Field Programmable Gate Array.” A single IC
containing an array of logic gates that can be “wired together” by a
user after manufacturing using programing code.</p>
<p><strong>Microcontroller</strong> – A small computer on a single IC
that includes a processor, memory, and input/outputs.</p>
<p><strong>IDE</strong> – “Integrated Development Environment.” Software
specifically designed for writing programs in a certain setting or
context (for example, a specific programming language).</p>
<p><strong>IC</strong> – “integrated circuit” or “chip”; a packaged set
of electronics, based on transistors, resistors, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Sketch</strong>- Arduino name for a program or instructional
code written on a computer input to the Arduino chip.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="programmable-circuits---introduction"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Programmable Circuits -
Introduction</h1>
<p>Suppose you want to build something more complex than the digital
circuits we studied in the previous experiment. For example, you might
have a photodiode that you want to hook up to a computer so you can
automatically adjust your experiment in response to changing light
intensity, maybe by adjusting the current powering a laser. Or, say you
want to build a tiny, battery-powered data transmitter to feed to a
dolphin and find out how her body temperature varies while she’s
swimming around in the ocean. Since it’s hard to transmit signals
through a dolphin, the transmitter should store the temperature data
until it is excreted by the dolphin and floats to the surface where your
receiver can detect the signal.</p>
<p>These and many other applications require complex digital circuitry.
Any digital system, including a programmable computer, can be built by
combining the gates and flip-flops we discussed in the previous
experiment. But it is hardly practical to build something like a
computer by connecting a bunch of TTL chips, since you could easily
require thousands or even millions of gates. There are much better ways
to get the job done. In fact, if you find yourself using more than a few
discrete logic gates in a circuit you are probably using the wrong
tools.</p>
<h1 data-number="4"
id="filed-programmable-gate-arrays-and-microcontrollers"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Filed Programmable Gate Arrays
and Microcontrollers</h1>
<p>Sometimes it is worth designing an application-specific circuit and
having it manufactured on a single chip. However, this is mainly
practical only for large-scale operations and not feasible for the
specific requirements of a single scientific experiment. Instead,
scientists make use of Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs). These are
chips containing many logic gates, and in most cases also flip-flops,
which can be programmed (sometimes only once, sometimes many times) to
interconnect the gates and flip-flops in a way that performs a custom
function (see H&amp;H 8.15, 8.27). A single FPGA can replace a large
pile of TTL chips, and the smaller FPGAs containing a few thousand gates
are inexpensive and relatively easy to program. The largest FPGAs can
contain 300,000 gates or more, and the programming effort can become a
major project.</p>
<p>But by far the most common approach to complex digital design is to
use a microcontroller, a single chip programmable computer. Compared to
most FPGAs, microcontrollers process data more slowly but with much
greater flexibility and power, and they are generally cheaper and more
power efficient. They are available in incredible variety, from 8-pin
versions costing less than a dollar to devices with processing power
rivaling that of a PC.</p>
<h1 data-number="5" id="arduinos"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> Arduinos</h1>
<p>In this lab, we will take a look at what microcontrollers can do by
working with the Arduino Uno board. “Arduino”, as they say at their <a
href="https://www.arduino.cc/">website</a> “… is an open-source
electronics prototyping platform based on flexible, easy-to-use hardware
and software. It’s intended for artists, designers, hobbyists, and
anyone interested in creating interactive objects or environments.”
Arduino has been highly successful in bringing out simple
microcontroller boards that can be programmed easily. These boards have
a huge international following that has resulted in a wide range of
books, publicly available programs, robotics kits, and the like. These
resources make the Arduino a common and easy choice when thinking about
a microcontroller project because it’s very likely that someone has
already solved your problem and has posted the solution code for FREE on
the Arduino website (or elsewhere on the internet).</p>
<p>The heart of the Arduino Uno is the 28 pin ATMEL ATmega328P. It is a
member of the ATMEL 8-bit AVR microcontroller family, with 32 kB of
8-bit wide program memory, 1kB of electronically erasable and
programmable read-only memory (EEPROM), and 2 kB of 8 bit data memory.
Program memory uses ‘flash’ technology, so you can program it over and
over again as you debug your hardware and code, and it is non- volatile,
so the chip won’t forget its programming when you turn the power off.
Programming can be done without taking the chip out of its socket on the
Arduino Uno board via a serial digital USB interface. You download a
program development environment from the Arduino site, plug the Arduino
Uno board into a USB port on your laptop, and start uploading programs
to the Arduino microcontroller.</p>
<p>Nearly every pin of the ATMEL ATmega328P microcontroller chip can be
programmed in multiple ways for various uses, and up to 23 of the 28
pins can be used as bi-directional digital I/O. There is an internal,
variable frequency clock and three separate timer/counter/scalers. For
dealing with analog signals there is a comparator with a programmable
voltage reference, 6 channels of pulse-width-modulated (PWM) output to
simulate adjustable external analog voltages, and to top it all off, a
10-bit analog-to-digital converter with a 6- channel analog multiplexer,
so you can digitize 6 separate analog signals. Amazingly, you can have
all this for around $3 per chip.</p>

your lab book.)</li>

<p>Now that you have a taste of what Arduinos can do, pick a simple
project and do it! It can be an extension of the flashing LEDs you just
made, or something completely different. Feel free to use any of the
components we’ve used in previous labs. Document your goals, approach,
progress, and results in your lab notebook. Remember that the lab
notebook should be a complete record which someone else could use
without difficulty to reproduce what you did. If you are having trouble
deciding on a project, there are some suggestions in the appendix.</p>
<h1 data-number="11" id="summary-and-conclusions"><span

<p>Write a two-paragraph summary in your lab notebook of what you
learned and any important takeaways.</p>
<h1 data-number="12" id="appendix-a-few-project-ideas"><span
class="header-section-number">12</span> Appendix: A Few Project
Ideas</h1>
<ul>
<li>Adjust your current 10-LED setup so that it counts up in
binary.</li>
<li>Use the potentiometer to control the brightness of the LEDs using
the concept of Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). As long as the LED is
flashing faster than about 60 Hz, it will simply appear solid. You can
flash with a varying duty cycle to make it brighter or dimmer. You can
do this yourself or with the “analogWrite” function. You could replace
the potentiometer with the input from the 3.5mm headphone jack plugged
into a device that is playing music so that the LED brightness depends
on the volume of the music.</li>
<li>Connect your speaker to one of the digital outputs. Use the “tone”
function to play frequencies. You can control the frequencies with the
potentiometer. Or, you can use the photometer circuit from Lab 7 to
provide the voltage so that the sound frequency is dependent on the
light level. Or you can use the “random” function to play random
frequencies.</li>
<li>Generate a periodic square wave with the 555 Timer circuit from the
last lab but configure it to use a potentiometer and a resistor to allow
for a range of frequencies. You should power the 555 Timer with the +5 V
from the Arduino. Feed the output of the 555 Timer circuit into the
Arduino and measure the length of time that the pulse is high and low
(see the “pulseIn” function). From that, calculate the period,
frequency, and duty cycle. Print out the information and see what
happens when you vary the potentiometer.</li>
