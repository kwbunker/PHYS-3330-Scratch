General Use</h1>
<p>An electrical signal can be amplified using a device that allows a
small current or voltage to control the flow of a much larger current
from a DC power source. Transistors are the basic devices providing
control of this kind. There are two general types of transistors,
bipolar and field-effect. The difference between these two types is that
for bipolar devices an input current controls the large current flow
through the device, while for field-effect transistors an input voltage
provides the current control. In this experiment we will build a
two-stage amplifier using two bipolar transistors.</p>
<p>In many practical applications it is better to use an op-amp as a
source of gain rather than to build an amplifier from discrete
transistors. A good understanding of transistor fundamentals is
nevertheless essential because op-amps are built from transistors. We
will learn later about digital circuits, which are also made from
transistors. In addition to the importance of transistors as components
of op-amps, digital circuits, and an enormous variety of other
integrated circuits, single transistors (usually called “discrete”
transistors) are used in many applications. They are important as
interface devices between integrated circuits and sensors, indicators,
and other devices used to communicate with the outside world.
High-performance amplifiers operating from DC through microwave
frequencies use discrete transistor “front-ends” to achieve the lowest
possible noise. Discrete transistors are generally much faster than
op-amps. The device we will use this week has a gain-bandwidth product
of 300 MHz (compared to 5 MHz for the LF356 op-amp you have been
using).</p>
<p>The three terminals of a bipolar transistor are called the emitter,
base, and collector (Figure <a href="#fig:NPN">1</a>). A small current
into the base controls a large current flow from the collector to the
emitter. The current at the base is typically about 1% of the
collector-emitter current. This means that the transistor acts as a
current amplifier with a typical current gain (<span
class="math inline">\(h_{fe}\)</span> or <span
class="math inline">\(\beta\)</span>) of about 100. Moreover, the large
collector current flow is almost independent of the voltage across the
transistor from collector to emitter. This makes it possible to obtain a
large amplification of voltage by having the collector current flow
through a resistor.</p>

<h1 data-number="4"
id="current-amplifier-model-of-a-bipolar-transistor"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Current Amplifier Model of a
Bipolar Transistor</h1>
<p>From the simplest point of view a bipolar transistor is a current
amplifier. The current flowing from collector to emitter is equal to the
base current multiplied by a factor. An NPN transistor like the 2N3904
operates with the collector voltage at least a few tenths of a volt
above the emitter, and with a current flowing into the base. There are
also PNP transistors with opposite polarity voltages and currents. The
base-emitter junction acts like a forward-biased diode with a 0.6 V
drop:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V_E \approx V_B-0.6~V\]</span></p>
<p>Under these conditions, the collector current is proportional to the
base current:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I_C = h_{fe}I_B\]</span></p>
<p>The constant of proportionality (‘current gain’) is called <span
class="math inline">\(h_{fe}\)</span> because it is one of the
"h-parameters", which are a set of numbers that give a complete
description of the small-signal properties of a transistor. It is
important to keep in mind that hfe is not really a constant. It depends
on collector current, and it can vary by 50% or more from device to
device.</p>
<p>If you want to know the emitter current, rather than the collector
current, you can find it by current conservation:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I_E = I_B+I_C =
I_C\left(\frac{1}{h_{fe}+1}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>The difference between <span class="math inline">\(I_C\)</span> and
<span class="math inline">\(I_E\)</span> is almost never important since
<span class="math inline">\(h_{fe}\)</span> is normally in the range of
100–1000, so you can generally assume that <span
class="math inline">\(I_E\)</span> = <span
class="math inline">\(I_C\)</span>. Another way to say this is that the
base current is very small compared to the collector and emitter
currents.</p>
<h1 data-number="5"
id="emitter-follower-and-common-emitter-amplifier"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> Emitter Follower and Common
Emitter Amplifier</h1>
<p>We will begin by constructing a common emitter amplifier (CEA), which
operates on the principle of a current amplifier. However, a major fault
of the common emitter amplifier is its high output impedance. This
problem can be fixed by adding a second circuit, the emitter follower
(EF), as a second stage. The common-emitter amplifier and the emitter
follower are the most common bipolar transistor circuits.</p>
<p>First consider the emitter follower (Figure <a
href="#fig:emitterf">2</a>). The output (emitter) voltage is always 0.6
V (one diode drop) below the input (base) voltage. A small AC signal of
amplitude <span class="math inline">\(v_{in}\)</span> at the input will
therefore give a signal <span class="math inline">\(v_{in}\)</span> at
the output, i.e. the output just “follows” the input. There is no gain
(the gain is 1) but we will see later that this circuit is still useful
because it has high input impedance and low output impedance.</p>
<p>Now consider the common emitter amplifier (Figure <a
href="#fig:emittera">3</a>). A small AC signal of amplitude <span
class="math inline">\(v_{in}\)</span> at the input will give the same AC
signal <span class="math inline">\(v_{in}\)</span> at the emitter (just
like the emitter follower). This will cause a varying current of
amplitude <span class="math inline">\(v_{in}/R_E\)</span> to flow from
the emitter to ground. As we found above, <span
class="math inline">\(I_E\gg I_C\)</span>, and so the same current will
flow through <span class="math inline">\(R_C\)</span>. This current
generates <span class="math inline">\(v_{out} =
–R_C(v_{in}/R_E)\)</span>. Thus, the common emitter stage has a
small-signal AC voltage gain of:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[G=\frac{-R_C}{R_E}\]</span></p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> this gain is about the change in voltage,
which is a bit different than the gains you have been working with so
far.</p>

<p>Figure <a href="#fig:emittera">3</a> shows the basic common emitter
amplifier, while Figure <a href="#fig:emitterabn">4</a> shows the common
emitter amplifier circuit that you will build with the biasing
resistors, power filter capacitor, and coupling capacitors in place. The
power filter capacitor connecting +15 V to ground serves to ensure that
electronic noise from the power supply does not enter the circuit. The
coupling capacitors on the input and output serve to transmit the AC
signal and block the DC voltage. For the input, this is essential
because if you feed DC voltage into something providing its own voltage,
bad things will happen. In this case, if the biasing DC voltage is
directly connected to the output of the function generator (<span
class="math inline">\(V_{in}\)</span>) the output buffer in the function
generator will break. For the output, the coupling capacitor is simply
convenient as we don’t care about the DC voltages, just the AC
signal.</p>

<p>This brings us to the biasing network. While we are usually trying to
amplify a small AC signal, it is essential that we setup the proper
“quiescent point” or bias voltages. These are the DC voltages present
when the signal is zero. Setting up the proper biasing often requires an
iterative process. Here are the steps to understand what is happening in
a transistor setup.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Set the DC voltage of the base, <span
class="math inline">\(V_B\)</span>, with a voltage divider (<span
class="math inline">\(R_1\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(R_2\)</span> in Figure <a
href="#fig:emitterabn">4</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>The emitter voltage, <span class="math inline">\(V_E\)</span>,
will be 0.6 V less than the base voltage.</p></li>
<li><p>Between the emitter and ground, there is one resistor so we can
determine the current flowing through that resistor, which is the same
as the current flowing out of the emitter: <span
class="math inline">\(I_E = V_E/R_E\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Recall that the emitter and collector current are approximately
equal so <span class="math inline">\(I_C = I_E\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>Using this current, we can calculate voltage drop across the
collector resistor and subtract that from the power supply voltage,
<span class="math inline">\(V_{PS}\)</span> = +15 V, to get the
collector voltage: <span class="math inline">\(V_C = V_{PS}~ –~
I_CR_C\)</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>If we have capacitors or inductors in parallel with (or in place
of) the resistors <span class="math inline">\(R_C\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(R_E\)</span>, then we would use the AC
impedances.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>For an emitter follower, the biasing is about the same except that
the collector is usually tied to the positive supply voltage so <span
class="math inline">\(V_C = V_{PS}\)</span>.</p>
<p>Determining the best values to use for the resistors and capacitors
depends on what the circuit needs to do.</p>
<h1 data-number="7"
id="output-range-of-the-common-emitter-amplifier-clipping-voltages"><span
class="header-section-number">7</span> Output Range of the Common
Emitter Amplifier (Clipping Voltages)</h1>
<p>Even with proper biasing of the transistor, the output voltage has a
range that is less than 0-15 V. Let’s determine the maximum and minimum
output voltages. Since <span class="math inline">\(V_{out} = V_{PS}~ –~
I_CR_C\)</span>, the maximum voltage will occur when <span
class="math inline">\(I_C = 0\)</span> and the minimum voltage when
<span class="math inline">\(I_C\)</span> is a maximum.</p>
<p><strong>Maximum voltage:</strong> This occurs when the transistor is
turned off and no current is flowing. As there is no current flowing
through <span class="math inline">\(R_C\)</span>, there is no voltage
drop across it. Thus <span class="math inline">\(V_{out} = V_{max} =
V_{PS} = 15 ~V\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Minimum Voltage:</strong> This occurs when the transistor is
fully on. The maximum current is flowing and there is very little
voltage drop across the transistor. The voltage is:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V_{out} = V_{min} = V_{PS} ~– ~R_C I_C~
(max)\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math inline">\(I_C~(max)\)</span> can be found by
considering the voltage drop from the power supply to ground when there
is no voltage drop across the transistor: <span
class="math inline">\(V_{PS}~-~R_C I_C ~-~ R_E I_E = 0\)</span>.</p>
<h1 data-number="8"
id="input-and-output-impedances-of-the-common-emitter-amplifier"><span
class="header-section-number">8</span> Input and Output Impedances of
the Common Emitter Amplifier</h1>
<p>The input impedance is the same for both the emitter follower and the
common emitter amplifier. The input impedance looking into the base of
the common emitter amplifier is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[r_{in} = R_E h_{fe}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(R_E\)</span> is whatever impedance
is connected to the emitter. If there is no load attached, it is just
the emitter resistor. However, if there is a load attached, <span
class="math inline">\(R_E\)</span> will be the emitter resistor in
parallel with the input impedance of the load (or the next stage). This
input impedance is for the base of the transistor. If there is a biasing
network in place, then the input impedance of the <em>circuit</em> will
be <span class="math inline">\(r_{in}\)</span> in parallel with the base
bias resistors.</p>
<p>The output impedance of the common emitter amplifier (Figure <a
href="#fig:emittera">3</a>) is just equal to the collector resistor
<span class="math inline">\(R_C\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[r_{out} = R_C ~~\text{(common
emitter)}\]</span></p>
<p>The output impedance of the emitter follower is found to be:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[r_{out} = \frac{R_B}{h_{fe} +1}~~
\text{(emitter follower)}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(R_B\)</span> indicates whatever
impedance is connected to the base. To be more precise, one should also
include the emitter resistor in parallel with rout for the true output
impedance of the circuit, but this is usually not necessary as rout is
usually much smaller than <span class="math inline">\(R_E\)</span>.
Also, please note the next section gives a more precise estimate of
<span class="math inline">\(r_{out}\)</span>.</p>
<h1 data-number="9" id="ebers-moll-model-of-a-bipolar-transistor"><span
class="header-section-number">9</span> Ebers-Moll Model of a Bipolar
Transistor</h1>
<p>Instead of using the current amplifier model, one can take the view
that the collector current <span class="math inline">\(I_C\)</span> is
controlled by the base-emitter voltage <span
class="math inline">\(V_{BE}\)</span>. For our purposes, the Ebers-Moll
model modifies our current amplifier model of the transistor in only one
important way. For small variations about the quiescent point, the
transistor now acts as if it has a small internal resistor, <span
class="math inline">\(r_e\)</span>, in series with the emitter. The
magnitude of the intrinsic emitter resistance, <span
class="math inline">\(r_e\)</span>, depends on the collector current
<span class="math inline">\(I_C\)</span>:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[r_e = 25~\Omega
\left(\frac{1~mA}{I_C}\right)\]</span></p>
<p>The presence of the intrinsic emitter resistance, <span
class="math inline">\(r_e\)</span>, modifies the above input and output
impedances to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[r_{in} = (R_e + r_e)~h_{fe}~~ \text{(CEA
and EF)}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[r_{out} = \frac{R_B}{h_{fe}+1}+r_e~~
\text{(EF)}\]</span></p>
<p>In addition, this modifies the gain of the common emitter amplifier
to:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[G = \frac{-R_C}{R_E+r_e}\]</span></p>
<p>which shows that the common emitter gain is not infinite when the
external emitter resistor goes to zero.</p>

oscillations. These must be suppressed before you can proceed. An
additional bypass capacitor (~100nF) between +15 V and ground close to

When you first turn it on, you may find that the output voltage has a
large DC offset due to charging of the output coupling capacitor. This

it doesn’t, you can add a 220 kW resistor to ground after <span

oscillates around 0 V with the scope channel set to DC coupling.</li>
<li>Measure the gain of the amplifier for 10 kHz sine waves using an
