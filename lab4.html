<p>In this lab, you will characterize the gain and frequency dependence
of op-amp circuits, one of the most useful components in electronics.
You will also measure input and output impedances of these circuits. The
op-amp is the most important building block of analog electronics. As
op-amps are made out of transistors, most textbooks discuss transistors
first, followed by op-amps. We choose the opposite order as we are not
particularly interested in how op-amps are constructed but rather how to
use them in circuits and the principles of op-amps operation are
actually simpler than for transistors.</p>

class="header-section-number">3</span> General Purpose of OP-Amps</h1>
<p>One of the main purposes of an amplifier is to increase the voltage
level of a signal while preserving as accurately as possible the
original waveform. In the physical sciences, transducers are used to
convert basic physical quantities into electric signals, as shown in
Figure <a href="#fig:lab-measurement">1</a>. An amplifier is usually
needed to raise the small transducer voltage (<span
class="math inline">\(\mu V\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(mV\)</span>) to a useful level (<span
class="math inline">\(mV\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(V\)</span>).</p>
<div id="fig:lab-measurement" class="fignos">

alt="Figure 1: Typical laboratory measurement system" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span>Figure 1:</span> Typical laboratory
measurement system</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>Measuring and recording equipment typically requires input signals of
<span class="math inline">\(10~ mV\)</span> to <span
class="math inline">\(10~ V\)</span>. To meet such needs, a typical
laboratory amplifier might have the following characteristics:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Predictable and stable gain. The magnitude of the gain is equal
to the ratio of the output signal amplitude to the input signal
amplitude.</p></li>
<li><p>Linear amplitude response, so that the output signal is directly
proportional to the input signal.</p></li>
<li><p>According to the application, the frequency dependence of the
gain might be a constant independent of frequency up to the highest
frequency component in the input signal (wideband amplifier), or a
sharply tuned resonance response if a particular frequency must be
picked out.</p></li>
<li><p>High input impedance and low output impedance are usually
desirable. These characteristics minimize changes of gain when the
amplifier is connected to the input transducer and to other instruments
at the output.</p></li>
<li><p>Low noise is usually important. Every amplifier adds some random
noise to the signals it processes, and this noise often limits the
sensitivity of an experiment.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>Commercial laboratory amplifiers are readily available, but a
general-purpose amplifier is expensive (&gt;$1000), and most of its
features might be unneeded in a given application. Often, it is
preferable to design your own circuit using a cheap (&lt;$1) op-amp
chip. Op-amps have many other circuit applications. They can be used to
make comparators, filters, limiters, rectifiers, oscillators,
integrators, and other devices. We will build some of these circuits in
later labs.</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="op-amp-basics"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> OP-Amp Basics</h1>
<p>Two basic op-amp circuit configurations, the non-inverting amplifier
and the inverting amplifier, are shown in Figures <a
href="#fig:non-invert">2</a> and <a href="#fig:invert">3</a>,
respectively. Both circuits use <strong><em>negative
feedback</em></strong>, which means that a portion of the output signal
is sent back to the negative input of the op-amp through the feedback
resistor RF. The op-amp itself has very high gain, but relatively poor
gain stability and linearity. When negative feedback is used, the
circuit gain is greatly reduced, but it becomes very stable. Also,
linearity is improved, and the output impedance decreases.</p>

</div>
<p>Both configurations are widely used because they have different
advantages. Besides the fact that the second circuit inverts the signal,
the main differences are that the first circuit has much higher input
impedance, while the second has lower distortion because both inputs
remain very close to ground. In this lab, we will be focusing on the
first-type, non-inverting.</p>
<p>The gain or transfer function, <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, of the <strong>op-amp alone</strong>
is given by</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[A\equiv\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}^+-V_{in}^-}\]</span></p>
<p>where the denominator is the difference between the voltages applied
to the + and - inputs. We use the symbol <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> for the gain of the complete amplifier
with feedback: <span class="math inline">\(G = V_{out}/V_{in}\)</span>.
This gain depends on the resistor divider ratio</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[B = \frac{R}{R + R_{F}}\]</span></p>
<p>If we assume an ideal situation where <span class="math inline">\(A =
\infty\)</span>, that the op-amp input impedance is infinite, and that
the output impedance is zero, then the behavior of these circuits can be
understood using the simple "Golden Rules":</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p><strong>The voltage difference between the inputs is zero.
("voltage rule")</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>No current flows into (or out of) each input. ("current
rule")</strong></p></li>
</ol>
<p>The “Golden Rule” analysis is very important and is always the first
step is designing op-amp circuits, so be sure you understand it before
you read the material below, where we consider the effect of finite
values of <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.1" id="non-inverting-amplifier"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1</span> Non-inverting amplifier</h2>
<p>The basic formula for the low frequency gain of non-inverting
amplifiers is derived in Steck Section 7.3.3. Using just the Golden
rules, which assumes <span class="math inline">\(A\gg 1\)</span>, the
gain is given by</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[G_{0} = \frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}
=\frac{R+R_F}{R} = 1 + \frac{R_{F}}{R}\]</span></p>
<p>Equations for the input and output impedance of the entire circuit
are derived in H&amp;H Section 4.26. The results are</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R_{i}^{&#39;} = R_{i}(1 + AB)\]</span>
<span class="math display">\[R_{o}^{&#39;} = R_{o}/(1 + AB)\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(R_i\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(R_o\)</span> are the input and output impedances
of the <em>op-amp alone</em>, while the primed symbols refer to the
whole amplifier with feedback. These impedances will be improved from
the values for the bare op-amp if <span class="math inline">\(A\cdot
B\)</span> is large.</p>
<p>The above formulas are still correct when <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and/or <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> depend on frequency. <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> will be frequency independent if we
have a resistive feedback network (in other cases that use complex
impedance it may not be), but <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
always varies with frequency. For most op-amps, including the LF356, the
open loop gain varies with frequency like an RC low-pass filter:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[A(f)=\frac{A_0}{1+j\frac{f}{f_0}}\]</span></p>
<p>The 3dB frequency, <span class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span>, is
usually very low, around 10 Hz. Data sheets do not usually give <span
class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span> directly; instead they give the DC
gain, <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span>, and the unity gain
frequency <span class="math inline">\(f_T\)</span>, which is the
frequency where the magnitude of the open loop gain A is equal to one.
The relation between <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(f_T\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f_{T} = A_{0}f_{0}\]</span></p>
<p>The frequency dependence of the closed loop gain <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is then given by:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[G(f)=\frac{G_0}{1+j\frac{f}{f_B}}\]</span></p>
<p>The frequency response of the amplifier with feedback is therefore
also the same as for an RC low-pass filter.</p>
<p>We can now derive an example of a very important general rule
connecting the gain and bandwidth of feedback amplifiers. Multiplying
the low frequency gain <span class="math inline">\(G_0\)</span> by the 3
dB bandwidth <span class="math inline">\(f_B\)</span> gives</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[A_0 f_0=G_0 f_B = f_T\]</span></p>
<p>In words, this very important formula says that the gain-bandwidth
product <span class="math inline">\(G_0f_B\)</span> equals the unity
gain frequency <span class="math inline">\(f_T\)</span>. Thus if an
op-amp has a unity gain frequency <span
class="math inline">\(f_T\)</span> of 1 MHz, it can be used to make a
non-inverting amplifier with a gain of one and a bandwidth of 1 MHz, or
with a gain of 10 and a bandwidth of 100 kHz, <em>etc.</em> We will
consider what this means for the transfer function as a function of
frequency on a Bode plot.</p>

<h2 data-number="7.1" id="op-amp-setup"><span
class="header-section-number">7.1</span> Op-amp setup</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This experiment will use both +15 V and –15 V to power the LF356
op-amp. <span style="color: red;">Make sure you <strong>unplug</strong>
the DC supplies while wiring your op-amp (you may find it useful to plug
them into their own power strip). Everyone makes mistakes in wiring-up
circuits. You should always check your circuit over before applying
power.</span> Figure <a href="#fig:lf356">4</a> shows a pin-out for the
LF356 chip. Familiarize yourself with the layout. The following
procedure will help you wire up a circuit accurately:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Draw a complete schematic in your lab notebook, including all
ground and power connections, and all IC pin numbers. Try to layout your
prototype so the parts are arranged in the same way as on the schematic,
as far as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Measure all resistor values before putting them in the circuit.
Make sure you are using the correct capacitors. Some capacitors indicate
the capacitance directly, but small capacitors usually just have a
number where 10 = 10 pF, 102 = 10x10<sup>2</sup> pF = 1 nF, 103 =
10x10<sup>3</sup> = 10 nF, 104 = 10x10<sup>4</sup> pF = 100 nF. Also,
see the important note below about polarized capacitors.</p></li>
<li><p>Adhere to a color code for wires. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span style="color: green;">0V (ground) Green</span></p></li>
<li><p><span style="color: red;">+15V Red</span></p></li>
<li><p><span style="color: blue;">-15V Blue</span></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The op-amp chip sits across a groove in the prototyping board
(see Figure <a href="#fig:pb">5</a>). Before inserting a chip, ensure
the pins are straight (using a needle-nose pliers or something similar).
After insertion, check visually that no pin is broken or bent under the
chip. To remove the chip, use a small screwdriver in the groove to pry
it out.</p></li>
<li><p>You will have less trouble with spontaneous oscillations if the
circuit layout is neat and compact, in particular the feedback path
should be as short as possible to reduce unwanted capacitive coupling
(see Figure <a href="#fig:pb">5</a>). Also, wire around the chip rather
than over it.</p></li>
<li><p>To help prevent spontaneous oscillations due to unintended
coupling via the power supplies, use bypass capacitors to filter the
power supply lines. A bypass capacitor between each power supply lead
and ground will provide a miniature current “reservoir” that can quickly
supply current when needed. This capacitor is normally in the range 1-10
µF. <span style="color: red;">Compact capacitors in this range are
usually <strong><em>polarized</em></strong>, meaning that one terminal
must always be positive relative to the other. If you put a polarized
capacitor in backwards, it will burn out.</span> You will probably hear
a pop and smell something foul. Please don’t do this. The negative side
should have an arrow on the capacitor. Also, the positive side should
have a longer lead but this is not a good identification method as the
leads can (and should) be cut. Bypass capacitors should be placed close
to the op-amp pins. If you are connecting the +15 V supply to ground,
the negative capacitor lead is connected to ground and the positive lead
is connected to +15 V. If you are connecting the -15 V supply to ground,
the negative capacitor lead is connected to -15 V and the positive lead
is connected to ground.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 data-number="7.2" id="testing-the-op-amp"><span
class="header-section-number">7.2</span> Testing the op-amp</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>You can save yourself some frustration by testing your op-amp
chips to make sure they are not burned out. Connect the op-amp as a
grounded-input <strong><em>voltage follower</em></strong> with the
(positive) input grounded (see Figure <a
href="#fig:voltage-follower-gnd">6</a>). What is the predicted voltage
on pins 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 using the Golden Rule model? Measure and record
the measured voltages on these pins. If your predictions do not match
your measurements check your connections to the chip to find the
problem. Make sure your predictions match your measurements before going
on.</p></li>
<li><p>If you find you have a bad chip, throw it in the trash and grab
another. (In case you are wondering, the LF356 costs about 50

<p>A voltage follower is the simplest version of a non-inverting
amplifier. The voltage follower has no voltage gain (G<sub>0</sub>=1),
but it lets you convert a signal with high impedance (i.e. very little
current) to a much lower impedance output for driving loads. The voltage
follower is also often called a unity gain buffer.</p>

id="low-frequency-gain-and-frequency-dependence-of-the-gain"><span
class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Low frequency gain and
frequency dependence of the gain</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The voltage follower circuit is nearly the same as the test
circuit, except that now a signal enters the positive input (Figure <a
href="#fig:voltage-follower">7</a>). The basic test and measurement
setup is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:op-amp-test">8</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the function generator to measure the low frequency gain.
What frequency should you use to test the low frequency gain (i.e., what
frequency should the signal be below)? Consider the gain-bandwidth
product for a unity gain amplifier. What is the gain-bandwidth product
for this circuit? How did you find the value? What is the predicted gain
for the frequency you chose? Measure the low frequency gain <span
class="math inline">\(G_0\)</span> by measuring <span
class="math inline">\(V_{in}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(V_{out}\)</span> using the scope. Do your
measurements agree with your predictions?</p></li>
<li><p>Now vary the frequency and look for deviation from the
performance of an ideal follower model. The measurement at high
frequency will depend on many details of your setup and you are unlikely
to find a simple RC filter type falloff. Using the 10X scope-probe,
measure the gain at every decade in frequency from 10 MHz down to 10 Hz,
with (as usual) a few extra points anywhere things are starting to
change. Do you find any deviation from unity gain? HINT: Be sure that
the output amplitude is below the level affected by the slew rate For
help, see H&amp;H p. 192. Plot the low and high frequency data and
predicted behavior on your Bode plot from your lab prep. Do you find a
simple fall-off as suggested by the theory for the ideal follower (<span
class="math inline">\(f_T=f_B\)</span>)? If so, find the 3 dB frequency.
How does your measured 3 dB frequency compare to what is expected from
the op-amp datasheet?</p></li>
<li><p>If you observed ideal behavior, youre lucky! At frequencies above
a few MHz, the simple model of the frequency response of the op-amp is
not accurate. Once you are in this frequency range, many physical
details of your circuit and breadboard can have large effects in the
circuit (see notes in 7.1.4 above). You could model these effects, but a
better procedure to follow is to modify the physical setup. Building
reliable circuits at these frequencies typically requires careful
attention to grounding and minimization of capacitive and inductive
coupling between circuit elements and to ground. Printed circuit boards
are much better for high-frequency applications. At lower frequencies,
our model of the circuit will work much better.</p></li>
