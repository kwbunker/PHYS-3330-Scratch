<h1 data-number="1" id="goals"><span
class="header-section-number">1</span> Goals</h1>
<p>In this lab, you will learn about the most basic elements of digital
electronics, from which more complex circuits, including computers, can
be constructed. Proficiency with new equipment and approaches:</p>
<ul>
<li>Logic gates, memory circuits, digital clocks</li>
<li>Combining components &amp; Boolean logic</li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="2" id="definitions"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Definitions</h1>
<p><strong>Duty cycle</strong> - percentage of time during one cycle
that a system is active (+5V in the case of TTL digital logic)</p>
<p><strong>Truth-table</strong> - table that shows all possible input
combinations and the resulting outputs of digital logic components</p>
<p><strong>Flip-flop </strong>- a circuit that has two stable states and
can be used to store state information</p>
<p><strong>Logic gates </strong> - a physical device that implements
some Boolean logic operation</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="digital-circuits---general"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Digital circuits - General</h1>
<p>In almost all experiments in the physical sciences, the signals that
represent physical quantities start out as <em>analog</em> waveforms. To
display and analyze the information contained in these signals, they
most often are converted into <em>digital</em> data. Often this is done
inside a commercial instrument such as an oscilloscope or lock- in
amplifier, which is then connected to a computer through a digital
interface. In other cases, data acquisition cards are added to a
computer chassis, allowing analog signals to be input directly to the
computer. Scientists usually buy their data acquisition equipment rather
than build it, so they usually don’t have to know too much about the
digital circuitry that makes it work. Almost all data are eventually
analyzed digitally with a computer. We emphasize analog electronics in
this course because scientists usually have to know much more about it
to design and build their experiments.</p>
<p>Analog information can be translated into digital form by a device
called an Analog-to-Digital Converter (A/D converter or ADC). A set of
<span class="math inline">\(N\)</span> bits has <span
class="math inline">\(2^N\)</span> possible different values, as you
might recall from Lab 5. If you try to represent an analog voltage by 7
bits, your minimum uncertainty will be about 1%, since there are 27 =
128 possible combinations of 7 bits. For higher accuracy you need more
bits. The corresponding device that converts digital data back into an
analog waveform is a Digital-to-Analog Converter (D/A converter or DAC),
which you built in Lab 5.</p>
<p>Logic gates alone can be used to construct arbitrary combinatorial
logic (they can generate any <em>truth-table</em>), but to create a
machine that steps through a sequence of instructions like a computer
does, we also need <em>memory</em> and a <em>clock</em>. The fundamental
single-bit memory element of digital electronics is called a
<em>flip-flop</em>. We will study two types, called SR (or RS) and JK.
The flip-flops we have chosen are from the TTL (Transistor- Transistor
Logic) family. A <em>digital clock</em> is a repeating digital waveform
used to step a digital circuit through a sequence of states. We will
introduce the 555 timer chip and use it to generate a clock signal.
Digital circuits that are able to step through a sequence of states with
the aid of flip-flops and a clock are called sequential logic.</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="digital-logic-states"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Digital Logic States</h1>
<p>The voltage in a digital circuit is allowed to be in only one of two
states: HIGH or LOW. HIGH is taken to mean logical (1) or logical TRUE.
LOW is taken to mean logical (0) or logical FALSE. In the TTL logic
family (see Figure <a href="#fig:TTLvolt">1</a>), the “ideal” HIGH and
LOW voltage levels are 5 V and 0 V, respectively, but any input voltage
in the range of 2–5 V is interpreted as HIGH, and any input voltage in
the range of 0–0.8 V as LOW. Voltages outside this range are undefined,
and therefore “illegal,” except if they occur briefly during
transitions. If the input to a TTL circuit is a voltage in this
undefined range, the response is unpredictable, with the circuit
sometimes interpreting it as a “1” and sometimes as a “0.” Avoid sending
voltages in the undefined range into TTL components.</p>

<h1 data-number="5" id="digital-logic-gates"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> Digital Logic Gates</h1>
<p>The flow of digital signals is controlled by transistors in various
configurations depending on the logic family. For most purposes, we can
imagine that the logic gates are composed of several ideal switches with
just two states: OPEN and CLOSED. The state of a switch is controlled by
a digital signal. The switch remains closed so long as a logical (1)
signal is applied. A logical (0) control signal keeps it open.</p>
<p>Logic signals interact by means of gates. The three fundamental
gates, AND, OR, and NOT, are named after the three fundamental
operations of logic that they carry out. The AND and OR gates each have
two inputs and one output. The output state is determined by the states
of the two inputs. The NOT gate has one input and one output.</p>
<p>The function of each gate is defined by a truth table, which
specifies the output state for every possible combination of input
states. The output values of the truth tables can be understood in terms
of two switches. If the switches are in series, you get the AND
function. Parallel switches perform the OR operation. The most common
gates are shown in Figure <a href="#fig:simpgates">2</a> and Figure <a
href="#fig:compgates">3</a>. A small circle after a gate or at an input
indicates negation (NOT).</p>

<h1 data-number="6" id="memory-elements-and-flip-flops"><span
class="header-section-number">6</span> Memory Elements and
Flip-Flops</h1>
<p>In sequential logic circuits, the output depends upon previous values
of the input signals as well as their present-time values. Such circuits
necessarily include memory elements that store the logic values of the
earlier signals. The fundamental memory circuit is the RS memory
element. The JK flip-flop has an RS flip-flop at its core, but it adds
circuitry that synchronizes output transitions to a clock signal. Timing
control by a clock is essential to most complex sequential circuits.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.1" id="rs-memory-circuit"><span
class="header-section-number">6.1</span> RS memory circuit</h2>
<p>The truth table for the RS memory element shows how the circuit
remembers. Suppose it starts in a state with Q=0 and R=S=0. A positive
pulse S at the input sets it into the state Q=1, where it remains after
S returns to zero. A later pulse R on the other input resets the circuit
to Q=0, where it remains until the next S pulse.</p>

<h2 data-number="6.2" id="jk-flip-flop-ttl74107"><span
class="header-section-number">6.2</span> JK flip-flop (TTL74107)</h2>
<p>There are three kinds of inputs to the JK flip-flop:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Data inputs J and K</li>
<li>The clock CK</li>
<li>The direct input clear CLR</li>
</ol>
<p>There are two outputs: <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> and
it’s complement (not-<span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>).</p>
<p>The index <em>n</em> counts the number of clock pulses since the
start of the experiment. In the absence of a clock pulse, the output
remains unchanged at the previously acquired value, <span
class="math inline">\(Q_n\)</span>, which is independent of the
present-time data inputs J and K. Only on the arrival of a clock pulse,
C, can the output change to a new value, <span
class="math inline">\(Q_{n+1}\)</span>. The value of <span
class="math inline">\(Q_n\)</span> depends on the J and K inputs in the
way specified in the truth table. The change occurs at the falling
(trailing) edge of the clock pulse, indicated by a downward arrow in the
truth table in Figure <a href="#fig:jkflipflop">5</a>. The direct input,
CLR, overrides the clock and data inputs. During normal operation, CLR =
1. At the moment CLR goes to zero, the output goes to zero and remains
there as long as CLR = 0.</p>

V.</li>
<li>Input logical values can be set by connecting wires from the gate
inputs to either 0 V (logical 0) or +5 V (logical 1). Use one long rail
on your prototyping board for 0 V and one for +5 V. *<strong>Note:
Disconnecting an input from the +5 V rail is not the same as connecting

own.</strong></li>
<li>The logic level of the output can be observed using a light emitting
diode (LED), which is connected from the output to ground. The LED
lights up when the output is +5 V and is off when the output is 0 V. To
limit the amount of current though the diode, place a resistor in series
with it. What value of resistor should you use to limit the current to
20 mA (don’t forget that the LED has a voltage drop of about 2 V)?
Record your calculation. You can either use the single LED (HLMP-C625)
or one of the LEDs from the 10-LED bank (MV57164). Check that the LED
lights up appropriately. If you don’t see light, try reversing the +5 V

or 1. If <em>A = 0</em> then <em>Ā = 1</em> and if <em>A = 1</em> then
<em>Ā = 0</em> . Here are some obvious identities using the AND, OR and
NOT operations. Looking at these identities you can see why the ‘plus’
symbol was chosen for OR and ‘times’ (•) for AND.</p>

<p>Each of the above equalities is a theorem that can be proved. Let’s
do an example by directly comparing the truth tables for the left and
right sides. We take on DeMorgan’s first theorem for two variables,

<p>Boolean algebra can be used to simplify logical expressions and
reduce the number of gates required in a circuit. In the figure below,
we show two ways to implement the expression, <span
