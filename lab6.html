detector) based on a silicon photodiode and a current-to-voltage

light. First, you will use it to measure the room light intensity. Then
you will set up and investigate an optical communication link in which
the transmitter is a light emitting diode (LED) and the receiver is your
photodiode detector.</p>

<h1 data-number="3" id="diodes"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Diodes</h1>
<p>A diode is a semiconductor device that has two terminals, an anode
and a cathode. These terminals are represented by (-) for the cathode
and (+) for the anode on the diagram in Figure <a
href="#fig:diode-char">1</a>. Diodes are made out of n-doped and p-doped
semiconductors. Visit this <a
href="https://phet.colorado.edu/en/simulation/semiconductor">PhET
simulation</a> for a good example of how these work.</p>
<p>The fundamental property of a diode is its tendency to conduct
electric current in only one direction. The diode can be operated in
three regions. The first region, called forward biased, is when the
cathode has a higher potential relative to the anode. Once this
potential difference is greater than some threshold voltage (about 0.6 V
for silicon diodes) the diode conducts with almost zero resistance and
has a constant 0.6 V drop across it. The second region of operation is
where the cathode has a lower potential relative to the anode. This
region is called reversed biased and essentially no current can flow.
Finally, if the potential difference from the cathode to the anode is
negative and larger than some breakdown voltage, the diode will again
conduct. Regular diodes are not used in the break down region, but Zener
diodes are used for this purpose.</p>

<p>The HLMP-C625 light emitting diode used in this lab acts electrically
like any other diode. However, unlike regular diodes it also emits light
when forward-biased due to direct radiative recombination of electrons
and holes. The forward voltage drop is about 1.9 V rather than 0.6 V
because the LED is made of AlInGaP instead of silicon.</p>

</div>
<p>The PD204 photodiode used in this experiment is a p-intrinsic-n (PIN)
silicon diode operated in reverse bias. A sketch of the photodiode
structure is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:photodiode">2</a>. The very
thin p-type conducting layer acts as a window to admit light into the
crystal. The reverse bias voltage maintains a strong electric field
throughout the intrinsic region forming an extended depletion layer. The
depletion layer should be thicker than the absorption length for photons
in silicon in order to maximize the efficiency. An incident photon whose
energy exceeds the bandgap energy can be absorbed to produce an
electron-hole pair by photoelectric excitation of a valence electron
into the conduction band. The charge carriers are swept out of the
crystal by the internal electric field to appear as a photocurrent at
the terminals. The photocurrent is proportional to light intensity over
a range of more than 6 orders of magnitude.</p>
<p>The photodiode sensitivity <span
class="math inline">\(S_{\lambda}\)</span> is the proportionality factor
that links how incident optical power <span
class="math inline">\(P\)</span> in Watts to a generated current <span
class="math inline">\(I\)</span> in Amperes. The photodiode sensitivity
<span class="math inline">\(S_{\lambda}\)</span> carries units of
A/W.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[I=S_{\lambda}P\]</span></p>
<p>It is important to keep in mind that here, Amperes is the current
flowing in the electrical circuit, whereas Watts refers to the incident
optical power, NOT an electrical power somewhere in the circuit.</p>
<p>What would <span class="math inline">\(S_{\lambda}\)</span> be for an
ideal photodiode in which every photon hitting the photodiode generates
one electron? Since each photon of light at wavelength <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> carries an energy <span
class="math inline">\(E_{\lambda}=hc/\lambda\)</span>, the rate of
photons hitting the photodiode is <span
class="math inline">\(R=P/E_{\lambda}\)</span> photons/second. But for
an ideal photodiode, every photon generates one electron with charge
<span class="math inline">\(e\)</span> that then flows out of the
photodiode. Therefore, the rate of charge flowing out of the photodiode
per second (i.e. the current!) is <span
class="math inline">\(I=eR=P~(\lambda e)/(hc)\)</span>. However, in a
real photodiode, not every photon gets absorbed and generates an
electron. We call the probability that an incident photon at wavelength
<span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> generates an electron, the
quantum efficiency of the photodiode <span
class="math inline">\(q_{\lambda}\)</span> with possible values between
0 and 1 such that <span class="math inline">\(S_{\lambda}\le
q_{\lambda}~(\lambda e)/(hc)\)</span>. At <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> = 690 nm (red), the ideal
sensitivity (i.e. <span class="math inline">\(q_{\lambda}= 1\)</span>)
would be 0.56 A/W, a fairly easy number to remember.</p>
<p>The quantum efficiency also depends on <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span>, so photodiode manufacturers
typically will provide the actual <span
class="math inline">\(S_{\lambda}\)</span> in the data sheet. Because
the PD204 photodiode comes with a curved lens, the data sheet specifies
the short circuit current <span class="math inline">\(I_{SC} = 10 ~\mu
A\)</span> at an incident intensity of <span class="math inline">\(1
~mW/cm^2\)</span> at <span class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> = 940
nm. The lens has a diameter of <span class="math inline">\(d = 0.3
~cm\)</span> or an area of 0.071 <span
class="math inline">\(cm^2\)</span>. So, an incident intensity of <span
class="math inline">\(1 ~mW/cm^2\)</span> corresponds to a total power
of 71 <span class="math inline">\(\mu W\)</span> of optical power
hitting the photodiode. The sensitivity is then:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S_{940} = \frac{I_{SC}}{71~\mu W} =
0.14~A/W\]</span></p>
<p>Note that this means the quantum efficiency at 940 nm is only 0.18,
not so great.</p>
<p>The sensitivity at other wavelengths <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> is given on the data sheet in
terms of the peak sensitivity <span
class="math inline">\(S_{940}\)</span> at 940 nm times a correction
factor called the relative spectral response, or RSR:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[S_{\lambda} =
S_{940}~RSR(\lambda)\]</span></p>
<p>Figure <a href="#fig:pd204">3</a> shows the RSR from the PD204 data
sheet. You can see the maximum sensitivity is around 940 nm.</p>

class="header-section-number">4</span> Current to Voltage Amplifier
(Transimpedance Amplifier)</h1>
<p>In an ordinary inverting amplifier, the input voltage is applied to a
resistor, and the amplifier generates an output voltage in response to
the current that flows through the input resistor to the virtual ground
at the negative op-amp input. A current-to-voltage amplifier (Figure <a
href="#fig:photodetector">4</a>) is an inverting amplifier with the
input current <span class="math inline">\(I_{in}\)</span> supplied by
the photodiode and applied to the inverting op-amp input. Since no
current flows into the op-amp input, the output voltage must be <span
class="math inline">\(V_{out} = – I_{in}R_F\)</span>. The ideal (Golden
Rules result) low-frequency gain of a current-to-voltage amplifier
is</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[G=\frac{V_{out}}{I_{in}}=-R_F\]</span></p>
<p>This gain has the units of impedance i.e., Ohms, and it is often
called a transimpedance gain. The current-tovoltage amplifier is also
called a transimpedance amplifier. This type of amplifier is very common
in research labs, and is used to amplify the current from photodiodes,
photo multiplier tubes, ion detectors, etc.</p>

<p>In our photometer circuit the current <span

capacitor <span class="math inline">\(C_F\)</span> enhances stability,
i.e., it helps to avoid spontaneous oscillations of the op-amp by
reducing the bandwidth of the amplifier (just like an active low-pass
filter).</p>

<li><p>We will first build the amplifier in a normal voltage amplifier
configuration to test the setup and all the connections. Build the
inverting amplifier circuit shown in Figure <a
href="#fig:inv-amp-cir">8</a>. Use a value for <span
class="math inline">\(R_F = R\)</span> close to what you found in <a
href="#sec:trans-pre">8.2</a>, and a 10 pF capacitor <span
class="math inline">\(C_F\)</span> in parallel with the feedback
resistor to avoid spontaneous oscillations. Draw the schematic in your
lab notebook and record the values of the components.</p></li>
<li><p>Predict the low frequency gain and 3 dB frequency of the circuit.
HINT: Look at your prelab answers. This will be the <span
class="math inline">\(R_FC_F\)</span> time constant from@sec:trans-pre;
in this circuit the time constant will be determined by the feedback
resistor and capacitor (not the input resistor). Design a test to ensure
the amplifier is working as predicted at low frequency (much lower than
the cutoff). Don’t bother testing the high-frequency behavior.</p></li>

<li><p>Set up a light emitting diode type HLMP-C625 as the transmitter
on a separate small circuit board according to the schematic in Figure
<a href="#fig:ocl">5</a>. Be sure to protect the LED with a series
resistance that prevents the forward current exceeding 20 mA. HINT: You
calculated the required resistance in the prelab. Also, the LEDs have a
nominal breakdown voltage of 5 V, which, if exceeded, can damage the
LED. Therefore, to prevent this from happening, connect a regular diode
in parallel with the LED but with opposite polarity. This will protect
the LED from a large negative voltage.</p></li>
<li><p>Set up the function generator to produce 5 Hz square waves with
the low voltage level 0 V and the high voltage of 8 V. You can
accomplish this by using the DC offset setting of the function
generator. Connect this to the oscilloscope and the LED circuit. Make
sure the oscilloscope shows a square wave that goes from 0 V to 8 V and
that you see the LED flashing 5 times per second before moving
on.</p></li>

class="header-section-number">12.2</span> Measure the output of the LED
with the photometer</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Place the LED transmitter close to the photodiode and verify that
the photodiode sees the light from the LED. The LED is directed forward
so make sure to orient both the LED and photodiode so they are pointing
at each other to maximize the amount of light detected. You can bend the
wire leads to get both devices pointed horizontally. You can check the
alignment by using a piece of white paper to see if the red illumination
is centered on the photodiode.</p></li>
<li><p>Observe the input driving signal and the output of the receiver
on the scope using DC coupling for both signals. Make sure the received
signal is due to the red LED, and not from an electrical connection. How
did you determine that it was working? You may want to increase the
frequency to about 100 Hz to allow the scope to update faster. You can
also try switching to AC coupling for the receiver to see if it is
easier to see the signal.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the frequency limitations of your photometer. We did
this in previous labs by measuring the frequency dependence of sine
waves to find where the gain dropped by 3 dB. This method is only
correct for sine waves. For square waves, we can use another method. A
low-pass filter in the time domain is an integrator. This means it
charges or discharges exponentially with a time constant of <span
class="math inline">\(RC\)</span>. Measure the time it takes for the
signal to rise from the base level (room lights) to <span
class="math inline">\((1–1/e)\)</span> of the maximum value or to fall
from the maximum value to <span class="math inline">\(1/e\)</span> of
the difference between the maximum value and the base level. This gives
the time constant <span class="math inline">\(RC\)</span>. As the 3 dB
frequency is <span class="math inline">\(f_B =1/2\pi RC\)</span>, you
can determine <span class="math inline">\(f_B\)</span>. Does this
measurement agree with your model predictions?</p></li>
<li><p>Measure the output of the transimpedance amplifier (in Volts) of
the transmitted light versus distance from a few cm to about 0.5 meter.
How does the background light from the room affect the signal? Explain
how you made this measurement. Estimate the the photodiode sensitivity
<span class="math inline">\(S_{\lambda}\)</span> at the wavelength 625
nm of light emitted by the LED. Plot the power in Watts hitting the
photodiode as a function of distance.</p></li>

<p>Write a two-paragraph summary in your lab notebook of what you
learned and any important takeaways.</p>
<h1 class="unnumbered"
id="appendix-a-some-related-concepts-about-measuring-light">Appendix A:
Some Related Concepts About Measuring Light</h1>
<p>The sun has a power output (radiant flux) of <span
class="math inline">\(P = 3.85~x~10^{26}\)</span> watts. Assuming a
transparent atmosphere and a 1 m by 2 m solar panel perpendicular to the
sun that absorbs 100% of the light, how much power is received? Consider
that the entire <span class="math inline">\(3.85~x~10^{26}\)</span> W is
distributed evenly on a hypothetical sphere with radius <span
class="math inline">\(1.50~x~10^{11}\)</span> m (distance from sun to
Earth). Since we know the area of a sphere is <span
class="math inline">\(4\pi r^2\)</span>, we can calculate the irradiance
or intensity (power per area) as <span class="math inline">\(N = P/4\pi
r^2 = 1360 W/m2\)</span>. Since the solar panel has an area of 2 <span
class="math inline">\(m^2\)</span>, the power delivered to the solar
panel is 2720 W.</p>
<p>There are additional concepts and units that are made necessary by
the fact that the eye is not uniformly sensitive to all wavelengths and
we are often interested in how humans perceive things. The luminous flux
is measured in units of lumens (lm) and is basically the same as the
power (measured in watts) except that the spectrum of emitted light is
weighted by the eye’s response. The conversion from radiant flux (power)
in watts to luminous flux in lumens is given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[F(lm) = 683
~y(\lambda)~P(W)\]</span></p>
<p>The dimensionless quantity <span
class="math inline">\(y(\lambda)\)</span> is the photopic standard
luminosity function and is shown in Figure <a href="#fig:lum">9</a> and
tabulated in the Datasheets section of Canvas. At <span
class="math inline">\(\lambda\)</span> = 555 nm, where the eye is most
sensitive, <span class="math inline">\(y(\lambda)\)</span> = 1.
Therefore, two sources with the same luminous flux will have the same
subjective brightness to a human observer (even though the outputted
power may be different). This kind of color corrected unit is helpful if
you want to design a control panel with lots of colored lights, and you
want them all to have the same perceived brightness. We may also be
interested in the luminous flux per unit area (similar to intensity).
This is measured in units of lux, where 1 lux = 1 <span
class="math inline">\(lm/m^2\)</span>.</p>
