class="header-section-number">1</span> Goals</h1>
<p>In this lab, you will characterize the frequency dependence of three
passive filters. You will gain more experience modeling both the
response of the filters and how your measurement tools affect your
measurements.</p>
<p>Proficiency with new equipment:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Oscilloscope probe</p></li>
<li><p>Capacitors and inductors</p>
<ul>
<li>Measure capacitance and inductance with an LCR meter</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Modeling the physical system:</p>

<li>Develop mathematical models of frequency dependent voltage
dividers</li>
</ul>
<p>Modeling measurement systems:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Refine the model of scope measurement tool to include capacitance
of the coax cable</p></li>
<li><p>Refine the measurement system to reduce the effect of the
capacitance of a coax cable</p></li>
</ul>
<h1 data-number="2" id="definitions"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Definitions</h1>
<p><strong>Scope probe</strong> - a test probe used to increase the
resistive impedance and lower the capacitive impedance compared to a
simple coax cable probe.</p>
<p><strong>Transfer function</strong> - the complex function <span
class="math inline">\(V_{out}/V_{in}\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Gain</strong> - the magnitude of the transfer function is the
voltage gain <span
class="math inline">\(G=|T|=|V_{out}/V_{in}|\)</span>. The power gain is
the square of this: <span
class="math inline">\(|V_{out}/V_{in}|^2\)</span>. If the gain is not
specified, you can assume it is the voltage (or amplitude) gain.</p>
<p><strong>Decibel (dB)</strong> - a measure of the power transmitted by
converting the power gain (or voltage gain) to a logarithmic scale. The
difference in power between output and input in decibels (dB) is <span
class="math inline">\(10~log_{10}~|V_{out}/V_{in}|^2
=20~log_{10}~|V_{out}/V_{in}|\)</span>. One common reference point is
where the ratio of output to input power is 1/2, which is <span
class="math inline">\(10~log_{10}(0.5) = -3~dB\)</span>. This
corresponds to <span class="math inline">\(|V_{out}/V_{in}| = 1/\sqrt 2
= 0.707 = 70.7\%\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Pass band</strong> - the range of frequencies that can pass
through a filter without being attenuated.</p>
<p><strong>Attenuation band</strong> - the range of frequencies where
the filter attenuates the signal.</p>
<p><strong>Cutoff frequency or corner frequency or 3 dB frequency, <span
class="math inline">\(f_c\)</span></strong> - frequency separating the
pass and attenuation bands. It is the frequency at the half-power (3 dB)
point, where the <em>power</em> transmitted is half the maximum power
transmitted. The output voltage <em>amplitude</em> at <span
class="math inline">\(f = f_c\)</span> is <span
class="math inline">\(1/\sqrt{2} = 70.7\%\)</span> of the maximum
amplitude.</p>
<p><strong>Low-pass filter</strong> - a filter that passes low frequency
signals and attenuates (reduces the amplitude of) signals with
frequencies higher than the cutoff frequency. Also known as an
integrator.</p>
<p><strong>High-pass filter</strong> - a filter that passes high
frequency signals and attenuates (reduces the amplitude of) signals with
frequencies lower than the cutoff frequency. Also known as a
differentiator.</p>
<p><strong>Band-pass filter</strong> - passes frequencies within a
certain range and attenuates frequencies outside that range.</p>
<p><strong>Band-pass filter bandwidth</strong> - the range of
frequencies between the upper (<span class="math inline">\(f_+\)</span>)
and lower (<span class="math inline">\(f_-\)</span>) half power (3dB)
points: <span class="math inline">\(\Delta f = f_+ - f_-\)</span>.</p>
<h1 data-number="3" id="application-of-filters"><span
class="header-section-number">3</span> Application of Filters</h1>
<p>A frequent problem in physical experiments is to detect an electronic
signal when it is hidden in a background of noise and unwanted signals.
The signal of interest may be at a particular frequency, as in an NMR
experiment, or it may be an electrical pulse, as from a nuclear particle
detector. The background generally contains thermal noise from the
transducer and amplifier, 60 Hz power pick up, transients from
machinery, radiation from radio and TV stations, cell phone radiation,
and so forth. The purpose of filtering is to enhance the signal of
interest by recognizing its characteristic time dependence and to reduce
the unwanted background to the lowest possible level. A radio does this
when you tune to a particular station, using a resonant circuit to
recognize the characteristic frequency. The signal you want may be less
than 10<sup>-6</sup> of the total radiation power at your antenna, yet
you get a high-quality signal from the selected station. Many
experiments require specific filters designed so that the signal from
the phenomenon of interest lies in the pass-band of the filter, while
the attenuation bands are chosen to suppress the background and
noise.</p>
<p>This experiment introduces you to the filtering properties of some
widely used but simple circuits, employing only a resistor and capacitor
for high- and low-pass filters and an LCR (inductor, capacitor,
resistor) circuit for a band-pass filter.</p>
<h1 data-number="4" id="filter-basics"><span
class="header-section-number">4</span> Filter Basics</h1>
<p>Whenever we discuss frequency in the lab, measured in Hz, we mean
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>, and this is the most relevant.
However, to avoid a bunch of factors of <span
class="math inline">\(2\pi\)</span>, the angular frequency <span
class="math inline">\(\omega\)</span> often appears in theoretical
derivations. Just remember that <span class="math inline">\(\omega =
2\pi f\)</span> so it is easy to convert. You should show results versus
<span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.1" id="rc-low--and-high-pass-filters"><span
class="header-section-number">4.1</span> RC low- and high-pass
filters</h2>
<p>The response of RC low-pass and high-pass filters to sine waves is
discussed in Steck 2.3.5 &amp; 2.3.7, H&amp;H 1.18--1.19, and
Fischer-Cripps 3.9--3.10. For these circuits, the magnitudes of the
transfer functions are:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\left| T(f) \right| = \frac{1}{\sqrt{1 +
(2\pi fRC)^{2}}}~ \mbox{(low-pass)}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\left| T(f) \right| = \frac{2\pi
fRC}{\sqrt{1 + (2\pi fRC)^{2}}} ~\mbox{(high-pass)}\]</span></p>
<p>For both filters: <span class="math inline">\(f_{C} = 1/{2\pi RC}\
\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(f_{C}\)</span> is the
frequency at which the power drops by 3 dB (which means it is half of
the maximum). In this lab, we are finding how efficiently signals of
different frequencies are passed. This is called the frequency domain.
Later, we will look at the time domain, where we see how the output
changes as a function of time. In that context, low-pass and high-pass
filters are called integrators and differentiators.</p>
<h2 data-number="4.2" id="parallel-lrc-band-pass-filters"><span
class="header-section-number">4.2</span> Parallel LRC band-pass
filters</h2>
<p>The LCR circuit is described in Fischer-Cripps 3.12, H&amp;H 1.22,
and Steck 2.6 (note that the Steck example is for a <em>serial</em> LCR
circuit so the concepts are the same but the details are different). As
this is another generalized voltage divider,</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V_{out} = V_{in} = IZ_{2} =
V_{in}\frac{Z_{2}}{Z_{1} + Z_{2}}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Z_{1} = R\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Z_{2} = \frac{j\omega L}{1 -
\omega^{2}LC}\]</span></p>
<p>The magnitude of the transfer function can then be calculated as:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[\left| T(\omega) \right| =
\sqrt{\frac{V_{out}V_{out}^{*}}{V_{in}V_{in}^{*}}}\]</span></p>
<p>where <span class="math inline">\(*\)</span> indicates the complex
conjugate. The algebra is left for you as a prelab exercise.</p>
<p>The resonant frequency, <span class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span>, and
quality factor, or <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> factor, are
given by:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f_{0} =
\frac{1}{2\pi\sqrt{LC}}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q = \omega_{0}RC =
\frac{R\sqrt{C}}{\sqrt{L}} = \frac{f_{0}}{\Delta f}\]</span></p>
<p>The resonant frequency, <span class="math inline">\(f_{0}\)</span>,
is the center frequency of the pass band, and <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> is equal to the ratio of the center
frequency to the bandwidth <span class="math inline">\(\Delta
f\)</span>. (These definitions are exactly true only for <span
class="math inline">\(Q\gg1\)</span>).</p>
<p>For a resonant LCR circuit the characteristic impedance, <span
class="math inline">\(Z_0\)</span>, is the magnitude of the impedance of
the inductor or the capacitor at the resonant frequency:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Z_{0} = \omega_{0}L =
\frac{1}{\omega_{0}C} = \frac{\sqrt{L}}{\sqrt{C}}\]</span></p>

high-pass filters in Figures <a href="#fig:low-pass-1">1</a> and <a

should be the resistance and capacitance of your circuit. Evaluate the
functions using the nominal values shown in the schematic. During the
lab, you can input the exact values of your components and thus quickly
predict the 3 dB frequency you expect for your circuit.</p></li>
<li><p>Create two Bode plots (one for each filter) of the frequency
response of the low-pass and high-pass filters in Figures <a
href="#fig:low-pass-1">1</a> and <a href="#fig:high-pass-1">2</a>. A
Bode plot is a log-log plot of the gain (<span
class="math inline">\(V_{out}/V_{in}\)</span>) versus frequency, similar
to what is on pages 61 &amp; 62 of Steck (although the Steck plots have
the x-axis in units of <span class="math inline">\(2\pi RC\)</span> and
you should use units of Hz). Make sure to include a large enough range
in frequency to see both the pass and attenuation bands. Make sure to
label your axes! Details about making plots nice are included in Lab
Skills Activity 2.</p></li>
<li><p>During the lab section, you will enter your measurements into
your Mathematica notebook and plot them with your model predictions. To
prepare for this, create a list of “fake data” and plot it on your Bode
plots. This will allow you to compare your model and measurements in
real time avoiding lost time taking lots of data when something is wrong
with your circuit. The point of this part is just to have you create
working code to enter a list of data and plot it along with the
function. The numerical values of the fake date are unimportant. There
is a helpful guide on Canvas about plotting data and theory together in

class="math inline">\(|V_{out}/V_{in}|\)</span>) over a large range in
frequency (100 Hz to 1 MHz) in at least one step per decade, with
several extra steps within the decade around your expected cutoff
frequency. Record your measurements in your lab notebook. Determine and
record the cut-off frequency for the low-pass filter. Compare your
measured half power point (<span
class="math inline">\(|V_{out}/V_{in}|=0.707\)</span>) with the cut-off
frequency computed from the actual component values used. Include your
comparison in your lab notebook. Then do the same for the high-pass
filter.</p></li>
<li><p>Test the predicted frequency response by plotting your data
points directly on your two Bode plots. Does the model agree with your
data? Explicitly record what criteria you used to determine whether or
not the model and measurements agree.</p></li>

<li><p>When the input frequency is at the resonance value <span
class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(V_{out}\)</span> will be a maximum and the phase
shift between the input and output waveforms will be zero. This gives
you two ways to find the resonant frequency. Find the resonant frequency
<span class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span> both ways. That is, adjust the
frequency so that (1) <span
class="math inline">\(|V_{out}/V_{in}|\)</span> is a maximum, and (2)
there is zero phase difference between <span
class="math inline">\(V_{out}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(V_{in}\)</span>. Record both measurements of <span
class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span>. Which method is more precise?
Explain why you think so. <em>Hint: try to estimate the uncertainty in
both cases.</em></p></li>
<li><p>The LCR meter measured the inductance of your inductor at a
particular frequency. Your inductor’s inductance changes slightly at
different frequencies. Use your measurement of <span
class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span> to get a more accurate measure of
<span class="math inline">\(L\)</span> on resonance by doing the
following. Compare the measured <span class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span>
with the expected value <span
class="math inline">\(1/(2\sqrt{LC})\)</span>. Refine the model of the
inductor by calculating a corrected value of <span
class="math inline">\(L\)</span> from the measured values of <span
class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, and use this refined value below.
Compare this value to the value you measured using the LCR meter in the
lab.</p></li>
<li><p>Determine the quality factor <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> by measuring the frequencies at the two
half-power points <span class="math inline">\(f_+\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(f_–\)</span>. Record your measurements. Recall
that <span class="math inline">\(Q=f_0/\Delta f\)</span> where <span
class="math inline">\(\Delta f=f_+-f_-\)</span>. <em>Hint: The
half-power points are where <span
class="math inline">\(V_{out}=V_{out}(max)/\sqrt 2\)</span>, not <span
class="math inline">\(V_{in}/\sqrt 2\)</span>.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Compare the measured value of <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> with your predicted value. Do they
agree?</p></li>
<li><p>It is common in all electrical circuits to find <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> values that are somewhat lower than
values you predict. This is due to additional losses in the circuit. In
this case the losses are primarily in the inductor. Measure the
inductor’s “equivalent series resistance” (ESR) using a DMM. You can
refine your model by including this resistance in your circuit. Draw a
schematic that includes this resistor. What is the predicted <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span> when you include this resistance in
your model? <em>See Appendix A. Does this result in better agreement
with your measured <span class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>?</em></p></li>
<li><p>Measure the gain (<span
class="math inline">\(|V_{out}/V_{in}|\)</span>) as function of
frequency. Use your model prediction to decide what values of frequency
to take data. Plot your measurements on the same graph as your model.
Does your data match your model prediction? Note, your transfer function
did not include the refined value of <span
class="math inline">\(Q\)</span>.</p></li>

<p>Inductors often have considerable resistance as they are just wires
wrapped around a ferrite core. One can include this resistance as a
resistor in series with the inductor. The refined model of the Q of this
system is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[Q_{refined} =
\frac{\frac{R}{R_{L}}}{R\sqrt{\frac{C}{L}} +
\frac{1}{R_{L}}\sqrt{\frac{L}{C}}}\]</span></p>
