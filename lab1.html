<h1 data-number="2" id="lab-notebook-guidelines"><span
class="header-section-number">2</span> Lab Notebook Guidelines</h1>
<p>The lab notebook will play an essential role in this course. You will
use your notebook for keeping records of many things including:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Answering lab-prep questions from the lab guide</p></li>
<li><p>Answering in-lab questions</p></li>
<li><p>Recording data</p></li>
<li><p>Including plots of data</p></li>
<li><p>Analysis and results</p></li>
<li><p>Diagrams and pictures</p></li>
<li><p>Procedures of experiments that you design</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The lab notebook will be an important part of your grade because
learning to keep a good lab notebook is an important part of your
professional development. You may find it helpful to write up many of
your notes on the computer, for example, within Mathematica or another
program. This is fine. However, before your notebook is turned in, the
notes, plots, and analysis should be transferred to the lab notebook by
printing and taping the pages or keeping them in a three-ring binder.
This is standard practice in research labs. Your lab notebook is the
main mechanism for communicating your process and results of the lab
experiments. Each week, you will be responsible for turning in both your
pre-laboratory work and your lab notebook / analysis via Canvas in
scanned format. See the syllabus for more information.</p>

<h1 data-number="5" id="setting-up-the-dc-power-supply"><span
class="header-section-number">5</span> Setting up the DC Power
Supply</h1>
<p>Your DC power supply will provide all of your circuits with the
required power. Setting up the power supply will always be the first
thing you do when you begin working with a circuit. The Keysight
EDU36311A DC Power Supply has three outputs that can be independently
controlled. Pages 43-45 of the User Guide (which can be found on Canvas)
discuss this in detail.</p>
<h2 data-number="5.1" id="set-up-the-dc-voltage-bias"><span
class="header-section-number">5.1</span> Set up the DC voltage bias</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>We want two of the power supply channels to be set up such that
the potential difference set on one of the channels is positive with
respect to ground and the other is negative with respect to ground. Each
channel has outputs labeled (+) and (-) and you will find that the
single output connector to the left of Channel 1 is connected to chassis
ground. The voltage indicated on the power supply display shows only the
potential difference between the (+) and (-) output. You must connect
the (-) to ground to get a positive voltage with respect to ground, and
the (+) to ground to get a negative voltage with respect to ground.
Since Channels 2 and 3 on the Keysight EDU36311A Power Supply have the
equivalent output voltage and current specifications, it makes the most
sense to use these two channels (see Figure <a
href="#fig:ps">1</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Confirm the sign and magnitude of the voltages displayed on the
power supply using the DMM. In your lab notebook, document the setup,
the output voltage from the power supply, and the measured output on
your DMM. <em><strong>Note:</strong> Hooking up the power supply to your
circuit with reversed polarity or to too high a voltage can cause your
components to be destroyed.</em></p></li>
</ol>
<h2 data-number="5.2" id="investigate-operating-modes"><span
class="header-section-number">5.2</span> Investigate operating
modes</h2>
<p>A voltage source maintains a constant potential difference while the
current output varies dependent on the load resistance (this is the
Constant Voltage (CV) mode). A current source maintains a constant
current while the voltage output varies dependent on the load resistance
(this is the Constant Current (CC) mode). The power supply will indicate
the operational mode of each channel in the upper right corner of the
respective channel window (in addition to CV and CC modes, the other
mode is OFF).</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>With no load attached, record the output voltage and current for
both power rails (see definitions).</p></li>
<li><p>Try adjusting the value of the voltage and current. Why is the
current output always zero?</p></li>
<li><p>Now short the (+) rail to ground. You can use a banana cable from
the rack to do this.</p></li>
<li><p>Vary the value of the voltage and current. Describe the behavior
of the voltage and current readings and the mode (CV/CC) of the power
supply. What happens when you short the output to ground (have too small
a load)? What is the maximum output of current and voltage your supply
can produce?</p></li>

<h1 data-number="6" id="measuring-voltage-with-the-oscilloscope"><span
class="header-section-number">6</span> Measuring Voltage with the
Oscilloscope</h1>
<p>The goal of this part of the lab is to be able to use an oscilloscope
(frequently referred to as scope or o-scope) to make measurements of DC
voltages and AC waveforms. You will also learn how to produce various
waveforms using a function generator.</p>
<p>There are a few precautions to observe when operating the
oscilloscope:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Avoid overheating the instrument. Do not block ventilation of the
interior.</p></li>
<li><p>Do not apply more than 300 V to any input terminal.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoid serious or fatal injury from electrical shock. Do not
remove the cover to expose the 120 V mains.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Otherwise, the instruments are robust and cannot be damaged by wrong
settings. So, try whatever youre curious about and measure and document
what happens.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.1" id="measuring-a-dc-voltage-on-a-scope"><span
class="header-section-number">6.1</span> Measuring a DC voltage on a
scope</h2>
<p>The Tektronix TBS 2000 Series has four independent channels so that
four separate signals can be displayed at once. Each trace is color
coded with the buttons on the panel.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Connect a +5V signal from your power supply to the scope using
the supplied connectors. Measure the voltage on scope using the cursors.
Try exploring the different knobs and menus on the scope to make the
measurement. Refer to the appendix listed at the end of this document if
you get stuck.</p></li>
<li><p>In your lab notebook, describe the setup of the electric circuits
(diagrams are useful) and the outcomes measured.</p></li>
</ol>
<p><em>NOTE: Oscilloscopes can only distinguish about 100 different
values on the vertical axes of the screen. So before you use the
oscilloscope to measure anything make sure that the trace covers at
least 50% of the vertical screen without clipping at the top or bottom.
This way you get a resolution/accuracy of approximately ±2%.</em></p>

<h2 data-number="6.2" id="triggering-an-ac-waveform-on-the-scope"><span
class="header-section-number">6.2</span> Triggering an AC waveform on
the scope</h2>
<p>Most scopes produce about 0-5 V square wave on the "PROBE COMP" pins
to use for testing. We will use this to get familiar with triggering the
scope.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Connect the Probe Comp output to the scope using mini grabbers
(see Figure <a href="#fig:grabber">3</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Display the waveform on the scope. You will need to trigger the
scope off of the waveform. Confirm with your instructor that you have
the scope triggered correctly before continuing. Describe the setup and
outcomes in your lab notebook.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The trigger level controls the voltage at which the trace starts.
Stability is lost when the trigger level lies outside range of the
displayed voltage. Change TRIGGER MODE to NORMAL. Note that the trace
now "freezes" when the trigger level is misadjusted. You can see whether
or not the scope is actually being triggered by looking for the small
writing TRIGD or TRIG? at the top of the display. <em>See Appendix for
the trigger menu.</em></p>
<p>What is the frequency of the waveform? You can measure the period and
then calculate the frequency using that measurement. Include your
measurements, procedure, and calculations in your lab notebook.</p>
<h2 data-number="6.3"
id="creating-an-ac-waveform-using-a-function-generator-and-measuring-it-on-a-scope"><span
class="header-section-number">6.3</span> Creating an AC waveform using a
function generator and measuring it on a scope</h2>
<p>The Keysight EDU33212A function generator can produce sine, square,
triangle, pulse, and ramp waveforms over the frequencies from 0.000001
Hz to 20 MHz. The output amplitude can be varied between 1 mV and 10 V
peak-to-peak with an output impedance of 50 <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>.</p>
<p><strong><em>There is one main precaution to keep in mind: Do not
connect any output of the EDU33212A directly to dc power or to the
output of any other instrument or circuit. Doing so will burn out the
output amplifier!</em></strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Create a 1 V peak-to-peak (p-p) sine wave at 1 kHz with no DC
offset (you may want to use this standard setup in the future if you
have trouble). You will need to set the output termination of the
function generator to HIGH Z (see <em>Appendix</em> or page 53 of the
User Guide).</p></li>
<li><p>Display the waveform on the scope. You can use a BNC cable (see
Figure <a href="#fig:bnc">2</a>) to make the connection. You will need
to trigger the scope off of the waveform.</p></li>
<li><p>Reduce the amplitude to 100 mV p-p. You may notice the scope
stopped triggering. This is because the waveform never crosses the
trigger level now.</p></li>
<li><p>The function generator has a trigger output that can be used to
trigger the scope (called Sync/Trigger Out). Using the trigger output is
more convenient than triggering the scope off of the waveform itself
because you avoid having to readjust the scope trigger every time you
change the waveform. Connect the Sync output of the function generator
to Channel 4 of the scope and trigger off of that waveform. Now change
the amplitude and frequency of the sine wave and notice how the scope
remains nicely triggered.</p></li>
<li><p>Come up with a waveform of your own that you want to create
(e.g., triangle wave at 1 MHz with a 200 mV p-p amplitude) and measure
its properties with the scope. Report on the one you created and record
this in your lab notebook. You can either print a screenshot directly
from the scope or take a picture and print it.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 data-number="7"
id="measuring-quantities-with-the-digital-multimeter"><span
class="header-section-number">7</span> Measuring Quantities with the
Digital Multimeter</h1>
<p><strong>The multimeter is a useful device to measure constant
voltages, currents, and resistances.</strong></p>
<p>To measure various quantities with the DMM, you must set the dial to
the correct setting and verify that the two leads are connected to the
correct input ports.</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Connect the leads and set the dial to measure resistance. Get
five 5k (5%) resistors form the stock drawers. Measure the resistance of
each resistor. Do all the resistors meet the 5% specification?</p></li>
<li><p>Connect the leads and set the dial to measure voltage. Measure
the voltage of both sides of the DC power supply again. Does the
measured value from the DMM agree with the value indicated on the power
supply?</p></li>
<li><p>Connect the leads and set the dial to measure current. Measure
the current produced by the power supply. <strong>Make sure the power
supply current is limited to a value below the fuse of the DMM.</strong>
How do you experimentally set the current limit? If you blow the fuse,
just replace it. Does the measured current from the DMM agree with the
value indicated on the power supply? Using the current and voltage
readings, what is the impedance of the ammeter? <em>HINT: The DMM leads
must be in different places to measure current vs. voltage. Also, it is
recommended to use the high current input until you are certain that the
current is low enough to be read by the low current input. This avoids
blowing the fuse.</em></p></li>
<li><p>The DMM also has an AC voltage setting. Over what frequency range
is the reading accurate to 2%? You will need to use the function
generator to produce an AC waveform. Note: the DMM displays the RMS
amplitude of the waveform. See Definitions at the beginning of the guide
for an explanation of RMS.</p></li>
<li><p>Remember in the future that this is the usable frequency range
for the AC setting of the multimeter. Record this frequency in your lab
notebook for future reference.</p></li>
</ol>
<h1 data-number="8" id="measuring-small-resistances"><span
class="header-section-number">8</span> Measuring Small Resistances</h1>
<p>In the previous section, you measured resistances using the ohmmeter
in the DMM. You will now use all the measurement techniques and devices
you have learned about to determine most accurate way to measure a small
resistance.</p>
<h2 data-number="8.1"
id="measure-a-small-resistance-using-a-dmm-ohmmeter"><span
class="header-section-number">8.1</span> Measure a small resistance
using a DMM ohmmeter</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Use a ~ 2 m length of magnet wire (26 or 28 gauge) as your small
resistor. Magnet wire has a very thin amber-colored insulating coating.
Make sure you remove the insulation from the ends of the wire to make a
good electrical connection and measurement of the diameter of the wire.
You can burn off the insulation with a flame or carefully scrape it off
with a razor blade.</p></li>
<li><p>What is the resistance based on the diameter, length, and
resistivity (the resistivity, <span class="math inline">\(\rho\)</span>,
of copper at room temperature is 1.68 <span
class="math inline">\(\mu\Omega\)</span>-cm)? Remember that <span
class="math inline">\(R = \rho l/a\)</span>, where <span
class="math inline">\(l\)</span> is length and <span
class="math inline">\(a\)</span> is area. It is hard to measure the
diameter of the wire with the insulating coating on and the stripping
process usually deforms the copper. However, you can just look up the
diameter of your particular gauge of wire online.</p></li>
<li><p>Use the ohmmeter in the DMM to measure the resistance of the
wire. <strong>Document your setup, measurements, and calculations in
your lab notebook.</strong></p></li>

id="measure-a-small-resistance-using-a-4-terminal-approach"><span
class="header-section-number">8.2</span> Measure a small resistance
using a 4-terminal approach</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Use your DC power supply to run a current through the wire. You
can then measure the voltage drop across the wire with a DMM to
determine its resistance based on Ohms law.</p></li>
<li><p>You can use the display on the power supply to measure the
current or use your DMM as an ammeter. (Consider the resolution of both
devices when making your choice.) You can use your DMM as a voltmeter to
measure the potential difference across the wire. Can you just use the
voltage reading on the power supply? Explain.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw a diagram of your experimental set up in your lab
notebook.</p></li>
<li><p>Consider how the amount of current flowing through your resistor
affects the sensitivity of your measurement.</p></li>
<li><p>Calculate the resistance of the wire from your measurements using
Ohms Law.</p></li>
</ol>
<h2 data-number="8.3" id="compare-the-two-measurement-techniques"><span
class="header-section-number">8.3</span> Compare the two measurement
techniques</h2>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>The ohmmeter in the DMM works by supplying a current and
measuring the potential difference between the outputs. How is this
measurement different than the 4-terminal approach you built? <em>Hint:
consider where the current is flowing and what resistances are involved
with each measurement technique. It is usually helpful to draw a diagram
including all the resistances, even of the wires in this
case.</em></p></li>
<li><p>Which method is more accurate for measuring small resistances
based on your explanation for part 1?</p></li>

<li><p>Single sequence: draws once after it triggers</p></li>
<li><p>Autoset: scope tries to choose overall best scope settings
(sometimes useful when you cant see anything, but generally used as a
last resort because it can also mislead you )</p></li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Measure Menu (top of panel):</strong></p>
<p>You can select various measurements and which channel to measure.
<em>Be very careful</em> with automatic measurements (again these can be
deceptive). Generally use cursors to make accurate measurements. Note
that the automatic mode searches for the very top and bottom of the
signals. For example, in the schematic of a noisy sine wave below,
automatic mode will return the upper and lower most lines which will
include the noise contribution. A careful manual measurement indicated
by the inner (shorter) lines can remove the noise from the amplitude
measurement. <strong>With small or noisy signals, the automatic mode
will give very poor results.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Cursor Menu (top of panel):</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Choose time (vertical bars) or voltage (horizontal bars)
measurement.</p></li>
<li><p>Choose which channel to measure (measurement cursors are the same
color as the channel they are measuring)</p></li>
<li><p>Big top knob moves the cursors</p></li>
<li><p>SELECT button changes which cursor to move.</p></li>
<li><p>Position relative to ground (trigger zero time) is displayed on
the screen with the "@" symbol.</p></li>
<li><p>Relative distance between cursors is displayed on the screen with
the <span class="math inline">\(\Delta\)</span> symbol.</p></li>
