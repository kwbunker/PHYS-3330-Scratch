amplifier</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The basic inverting amplifier is shown in Figure <a
href="#fig:invamp">1</a>. We can use the Golden Rules to determine the
low-frequency gain. Since the positive input is grounded, the op-amp
will do everything it can to keep the negative input at ground as well.
In the limit of infinite open loop gain the inverting input of the
op-amp is a <u>virtual ground</u>, a circuit node that will stay at
ground as long as the circuit is working, even though it is not directly
connected to ground. When <strong><em>A is infinite,</em></strong> the
gain of an inverting amplifier is</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[G_0=\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}=-\frac{R_f}{R}\]</span></p>
<p>This is the "Golden Rule" result. For the frequency dependence of the
gain we need to consider what happens when <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is not infinite, as we did for the
non-inverting case. We use the same definitions as for the non-inverting
case. The op-amp open loop gain is <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>, and the divider ratio <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> is the same as before:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[B=\frac{R}{R+R_f}\]</span></p>
<p>When <strong><em>A is finite</em></strong> the gain for an inverting
amplifier is given by</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[G_0=\frac{V_{out}}{V_{in}}=-\frac{A(1-B)}{1+AB}\]</span></p>
<p>The above formulas are still correct when <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and/or <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> depend on frequency. <span
class="math inline">\(B\)</span> will be frequency independent if we
only have resistors (in other cases that use complex impedance it may
not be), but <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> always varies with
frequency. For most op-amps, including the LF356, the open loop gain
varies with frequency like an RC low-pass filter:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[A(f)=\frac{A_0}{1+j\frac{f}{f_0}}\]</span></p>
<p>The 3 B frequency, <span class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span>, is
usually very low, around 10 Hz. Data sheets do not usually give <span
class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span> directly; instead they give the DC
gain, <span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span>, and the unity gain
frequency <span class="math inline">\(f_T\)</span>, which is the
frequency where the magnitude of the open loop gain <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is equal to one. The relation between
<span class="math inline">\(A_0\)</span>, <span
class="math inline">\(f_0\)</span>, and <span
class="math inline">\(f_T\)</span> is</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[f_{T} = A_{0}f_{0}\]</span></p>
<p>The frequency dependence of the closed loop gain <span
class="math inline">\(G\)</span> is then given by</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[G=\frac{G_0}{1+j\frac{f}{f_B}}\]</span></p>
<p>The frequency response of the amplifier with feedback is therefore
also the same as for an RC low-pass filter.</p>
<h2 data-number="3.1"
id="input-and-output-impedances-of-inverting-amplifiers"><span
class="header-section-number">3.1</span> Input and output impedances of
inverting amplifiers</h2>
<p>Formulas for the input and output impedance for an inverting
amplifier are derived in H&amp;H Section 4.26. When the open loop gain
is large, the negative input of the op-amp is a virtual ground and so
the input impedance is just equal to <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span>. This is very different from the
non-inverting case where the input impedance is proportional to <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> for large <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span>. In practice, the input impedance of an
inverting amplifier is not usually greater than about 100 k<span
class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>, while the input impedance of a
non-inverting amplifier can easily be as large as 10<sup>12</sup> <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>. When <span
class="math inline">\(A\)</span> is not large the formulas for the input
impedance and output impedance of the entire circuit are derived in
H&amp;H Section 4.26. The results are</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R_{i}^{&#39;} = R + \frac{R_{f}}{1 +
A}\]</span></p>
<p><span class="math display">\[R_{o}^{&#39;} = \frac{R_{o}}{(1 +
AB)}\]</span></p>
<p>The output impedance is the same for both the inverting and
non-inverting amplifiers.</p>
<p>The gain-bandwidth product for inverting amplifier is slightly
modified compared to non-inverting amps.</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[A_{0}f_{0} = \frac{{{- G}_{0}f}_{B}}{1 -
B} = f_{T}\]</span></p>
<p>This is the same (except for the sign) as the non-inverting result
when the closed loop gain is large (<span class="math inline">\(B \ll 1,
|G0| \gg 1\)</span>), but at unity closed loop gain (<span
class="math inline">\(B = 1/2, G_0 = -1\)</span>) the inverting
amplifier has only half as much bandwidth as a non-inverting
amplifier.</p>

<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span>Figure 2:</span> Summing
amplifier</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The Summing Amplifier, shown in Figure <a href="#fig:sumamp">2</a>,
is a very flexible circuit based upon the standard inverting op-amp
configuration that can be used for combining multiple inputs. The
standard inverting amplifier, shown in Figure <a
href="#fig:invamp">1</a>, has a single input voltage, <span
class="math inline">\(V_{in}\)</span>, applied to the inverting input
terminal. If we add more input resistors to the input, the circuit can
become a voltage adder with different gain for each input. There are
many applications for summing amplifiers including audio mixers and
digital to analog converters. Using the Golden Rules we can determine
the transfer function listed below.</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[V_{out}=-\left[V_1\left(\frac{R_F}{R_1}\right) +
V_2\left(\frac{R_F}{R_2}\right) +
V_3\left(\frac{R_F}{R_3}\right)\right]\]</span></p>
<p>This circuit has many applications including working as an adder in
any basis-set you specify. If you only restrict yourself to input
voltages of 0 or 1 V (or on and off), you get to a binary adder and can
convert binary signals to analog (e.g. base 2 to base 10).
Digital-to-analog converters are found in every research lab (or
computer, or phone, etc.) where you want to create any value of a signal
from just 1’s and 0’s. If you want a refresher on binary or counting in
binary, you can <a

<figcaption aria-hidden="true"><span>Figure 3:</span>
Integrator</figcaption>
</figure>
</div>
<p>The basic op-amp integrator is shown in Figure <a
href="#fig:integrator">3</a>. As compared to the inverting amplifier in
Figure <a href="#fig:invamp">1</a>, the only change is a replacement of
the feedback resistor <span class="math inline">\(R_F\)</span> with a
capacitor <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. An integrator is the
same circuit as a low-pass filter. If you are interested in what
frequencies get passed, you call it a low-pass filter. If you are
interested in integrating the input signal, you call it an integrator.
We can understand how the integrator works by applying the Golden Rules
and remembering the defining equation for capacitors. Just as in the
integrating amplifier, the Golden Rules tells us that <span
class="math inline">\(V_-\approx V_+ = 0\)</span> and that the current
across both components is the same because no current flows into the
op-amp. We label <span class="math inline">\(I_R\)</span> as the current
through the resistor, which is <span
class="math inline">\(V_{in}/R\)</span> since <span
class="math inline">\(V_-\)</span> is at ground. We label <span
class="math inline">\(I_C\)</span> as the current across the capacitor.
The defining equation for capacitors is <span
class="math inline">\(Q=CV\)</span>. The current through a capacitor is
<span class="math inline">\(I=dQ/dt = d(CV)/dt = CdV/dt\)</span>.
Therefore, the equation <span class="math inline">\(I_R=I_C\)</span>
becomes:</p>
<p><span
class="math display">\[\frac{V_{in}}{R}=-C~\frac{dV_{out}}{dt}\]</span></p>
<p>Solving this equation for <span
class="math inline">\(V_{out}\)</span> gives the following:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[V_{out}=-\frac{1}{RC}\int V_{in}
~dt\]</span></p>
<p>This is why it is called an integrator. Choosing values for the
resistor and capacitor depends on several considerations. First, one
needs to determine the value of the product <span
class="math inline">\(RC\)</span>. This will depend on the expected
signal (size and shape), the expected integration time, and the desired
output (remembering the op-amp limitations on maximum output voltage and
slew rate). Once <span class="math inline">\(RC\)</span> is determined,
some considerations for choosing <span class="math inline">\(R\)</span>
and <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> are:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Availability: resistors from 1 <span
class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> to 10 M<span
class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> and capacitors from 2 pF to 1
<span class="math inline">\(\mu\)</span>F are readily
available.</p></li>
<li><p>Input impedance: generally a high input impedance (&gt; 1 k<span
class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span>) is desired to avoid loading the
input signal.</p></li>
<li><p>Avoiding effect of stray capacitance: there are many sources of
capacitance, such as cables, which can unintentionally couple to your
circuit. For this reason, it is advisable to avoid very small capacitors
as the stray capacitances may end up dominating. A few hundred pF should
be sufficient.</p></li>
<li><p>Dealing with DC signal: A DC signal in the input results in the
capacitor eventually charging up to the<br />
maximum output voltage of the op-amp. This DC signal can result from the
op-amp. One way to mitigate this is to add another resistor in parallel
with the capacitor such that at low frequencies (large impedance in
capacitor) the circuit acts like an inverting amplifier. As the
impedance of a resistor is proportional to <span
class="math inline">\(R\)</span> while the impedance of a capacitor is
inversely proportional to <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, to
ensure that the signal mainly goes through the capacitor, one would like
large resistor and/or large capacitor values. Of course, the resistor
chosen here in combination to the main resistor in the circuit leads to
a DC gain as calculated for the inverting amplifier so this should be
considered in making your choice. You can alternatively try placing the
high impedance resistor between <span
class="math inline">\(V_{out}\)</span> and ground instead of in parallel
with the capacitor.</p></li>

class="header-section-number">9</span> General Op-Amp Tips</h1>
<p><strong>These are reminders of the basics steps you should always
follow when working with op-amps.</strong></p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>This experiment will use both +15 V and –15 V to power the LF356
op-amp. <span style="color: red;">Make sure you <strong>unplug</strong>
the DC supplies while wiring your op-amp (you may find it useful to plug
them into their own power strip). Everyone makes mistakes in wiring-up
circuits. You should always check your circuit over before applying
power.</span> Figure <a href="#fig:lf356">4</a> shows a pin-out for the
LF356 chip. Familiarize yourself with the layout. The following
procedure will help you wire up a circuit accurately:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li><p>Draw a complete schematic in your lab notebook, including all
ground and power connections, and all IC pin numbers. Try to layout your
prototype so the parts are arranged in the same way as on the schematic,
as far as possible.</p></li>
<li><p>Measure all resistor values before putting them in the circuit.
Make sure you are using the correct capacitors. Some capacitors indicate
the capacitance directly, but small capacitors usually just have a
number where 10 = 10 pF, 102 = 10x10<sup>2</sup> pF = 1 nF, 103 =
10x10<sup>3</sup> = 10 nF, 104 = 10x10<sup>4</sup> pF = 100 nF. Also,
see the important note below about polarized capacitors.</p></li>
<li><p>Adhere to a color code for wires. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><span style="color: green;">0V (ground) Green</span></p></li>
<li><p><span style="color: red;">+15V Red</span></p></li>
<li><p><span style="color: blue;">-15V Blue</span></p></li>
</ul></li>
</ol></li>
<li><p>The op-amp chip sits across a groove in the prototyping board
(see Figure <a href="#fig:pb">5</a>). Before inserting a chip, ensure
the pins are straight (using a needle-nose pliers or something similar).
After insertion, check visually that no pin is broken or bent under the
chip. To remove the chip, use a small screwdriver in the groove to pry
it out.</p></li>
<li><p>You will have less trouble with spontaneous oscillations if the
circuit layout is neat and compact, in particular the feedback path
should be as short as possible to reduce unwanted capacitive coupling
(see Figure <a href="#fig:pb">5</a>). Also, wire around the chip rather
than over it.</p></li>
<li><p>To help prevent spontaneous oscillations due to unintended
coupling via the power supplies, use bypass capacitors to filter the
power supply lines. A bypass capacitor between each power supply lead
and ground will provide a miniature current “reservoir” that can quickly
supply current when needed. This capacitor is normally in the range 1-10
µF. <span style="color: red;">Compact capacitors in this range are
usually <strong><em>polarized</em></strong>, meaning that one terminal
must always be positive relative to the other. If you put a polarized
capacitor in backwards, it will burn out.</span> You will probably hear
a pop and smell something foul. Please don’t do this. The negative side
should have an arrow on the capacitor. Also, the positive side should
have a longer lead but this is not a good identification method as the
leads can (and should) be cut. Bypass capacitors should be placed close
to the op-amp pins. If you are connecting the +15 V supply to ground,
the negative capacitor lead is connected to ground and the positive lead
is connected to +15 V. If you are connecting the -15 V supply to ground,
the negative capacitor lead is connected to -15 V and the positive lead
is connected to ground.</p></li>

<ol type="1">
<li><p>Build the inverting amplifier shown in Figure <a
href="#fig:invamp">1</a>, with <span class="math inline">\(R_F = 100
~k\Omega\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(R = 10

<span class="math inline">\(R_F\)</span> with the DMM before inserting
them into the circuit board. Predict <span

op-amps value of <span class="math inline">\(f_T\)</span> from the data
sheet. (You should be able to review your prelab work here!)</p></li>
<li><p>Use the function generator to measure the low frequency gain.
What frequency should you use to test the low frequency gain (i.e., what
frequency should the signal be below?) Consider the gain-bandwidth
product and how it relates to your circuit. What is the predicted gain
for the frequency you chose? Measure the low frequency gain <span
class="math inline">\(G_0\)</span> by measuring <span
class="math inline">\(V_{in}\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(V_{out}\)</span> using the scope (as you did in
Lab 4). Do your measurements agree with your predictions?</p></li>
<li><p>Predict the 3 dB frequency for your circuit. Include your
calculations in your lab book. Now, determine the 3 dB frequency
experimentally. Describe the procedure you followed to determine <span
class="math inline">\(f_B\)</span>. Does your measurement agree with
your prediction? Explicitly record what criteria you used to determine
whether or not the model and measurements agree.</p></li>
<li><p>Using the gain-bandwidth relation and your measurements of <span
class="math inline">\(G_0\)</span> and <span
class="math inline">\(f_B\)</span> to determine <span
class="math inline">\(f_T\)</span> for your op-amp. Does your measured
value of <span class="math inline">\(f_T\)</span> agree with the one
from the datasheet?</p></li>
<li><p>Measure the frequency dependence of your circuit. Measure the
gain at every decade in frequency from 10 Hz to 10 MHz. Should you use a
10X probe or coax cable to make your measurements? Explain your
reasoning. Plot your measurements and predicted gain curve on the same
plot. Where, if at all, is the simple model of the op-amp circuit not
valid? Can you suggest possible model refinements and/or physical system
refinements to get better agreement between the model predictions and
measurements.</p></li>

<p>Use your summing amplifier in “digital to analog conversion mode” to
create integer output voltages from 0 to –7 V from two input voltages (0
V and 1 V). Predict what set of input voltages is required to get each
desired output voltage (<em>Hint: You did this in your prelab</em>). Do
your measurements agree with your predictions for all eight voltages?
How accurately were you able to make integer values of voltage? Describe
a way to refine the physical system to more accurately create exact

<p>By now, you should be somewhat comfortable with experimental design
and reporting of outcomes, especially with op-amps and voltage dividers.
In this last section, you will design and characterize an integrator.
Your starting point should be the integrator circuit you designed in the
prelab. Items you likely wish to include in your lab notebook:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Describe the circuit you are building and testing. It is
suggested that you use R = 10 k<span
class="math inline">\(\Omega\)</span> and the necessary capacitor to
obtain a time constant of 1 ms.</p></li>
<li><p>Draw the schematic of the circuit with component values
labeled.</p></li>
<li><p>List your predictions / models. It is fine to start by using
ideal models.</p></li>
<li><p>How do you plan to test it? Be sure to use square, triangle, and
sine waves at various frequencies.</p></li>
<li><p>The results of the tests with various inputs.</p></li>
<li><p>Do the results match your model? What didn’t match?</p></li>
<li><p>How would you refine your model or physical system to get better
agreement?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have an issue where the output seems to be at the rail voltage
of the op-amp, you likely have a DC signal on the input (in addition to
the AC signal). You should review the integrator theory section for ways
to alleviate this.</p>
